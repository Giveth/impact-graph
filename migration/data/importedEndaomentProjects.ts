      'ASYLUM PROTECTION CENTER (APC) was founded in 2007 and from the very beginning of the asylum system in Serbia (2008) has been providing legal, psychosocial and interaction/integration aid to exiles, asylum seekers and persons who have been granted asylum or other protection in the Republic of Serbia (with special focus to children and youth- providing legal, psychosocial, interaction/integration aid to minors, unaccompanied minors and youth). Activities of the APC as grass root organization are reflected through our strong presence and engagement at local levels in local communities, in order to establish a dialogue and interaction between asylum seekers/refugees/exiles and local citizens; primarily through the organization of public local events, exhibitions, fairs, asylum corners, interaction/integration, creative and other workshops, round tables, work of APC local networks of volunteers and APC interns, cultural mediators support and other events and activities in local communities, as well as through numerous collaborations with local governments, organizations, institutions, schools, local cultural and youth centers. APC political scientists and researchers actively work in the field of research and advocacy, using extensive APC experience and field data, in order to get to the root of issues and problems of the migration, asylum system and refugees, strengthening and spreading information to the wider general and local public and experts, advocating and fighting to reduce prejudice and xenophobia in local and general public thus building more tolerant and inclusive society in Serbia. Since its founding, lawyers, psychologists, pedagogues, social workers and translators that make up the APC/CZA team have worked first hand with the refugees and migrants in the first asylum centers. Since the opening of the Balkan route, our team can be found  across all reception and transit centers, parks, buses, railways stations, at improvised shelters in open air surroundings by the border, in suburbs, on the streets, in forests and in institutions for youth. We have reunified families, discovered smuggling routes and found children who had been lost. Our team continues to protect persons from discrimination and violence, while simultaneously reporting abuse that are endured by vulnerable groups of migrants and refugees. With the help of Social work centers we have placed children in foster families, enabled the healthy births of children, provided birth certificates for refugee babies born in Serbia and reunified children with their families we have ultimately helped wherever we could. APC/CZA has established one of the first mobile applications in Europe - "Asylum in Serbia", providing not only all necessary basic information, placing mechanism tools for reporting abuse in the hands of migrants and refugees, that are necessary in their journey\'s through the country, or their long term stays in Serbia. With tireless legal assistance and interpretation of regulations, we managed to provide health care (primary, secondary and tertiary protection) to asylum seekers who should receive care equal to the rights of Serbian citizens. In cooperation with local communities in Bogovadja and Lajkovac, the APC/CZA team, as early as 2012 began enrolling the children of asylum seekers into the Serbian educational system, in both elementary and secondary education institutions. We currently continue with this practice and as a result of our engagement with children who attend elementary school in Belgrade, Krnjaca, Sjenica and Tutin, they are able to receive full-time education, have become excellent and thoroughly satisfied students.<br><br>We are the first in Serbia to have begun the integration process of refugees and asylum seekers in the country- by assisting them to find work, accommodation, the obtaining of documents, ease in overcoming psychological problems and adaptation problems that may have resulted due to their new environment surroundings, regulations, mentality and the culture in Serbia.<br><br>We have managed to validate and recognize the first pages of diplomas for those who received asylum in Serbia.<br><br>We provided the first work permits for more than 40 asylum seekers and those who received asylum and established a legal practice enabling and ensuring them with the right to work. Furthermore, APC/CZA also led disputes before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg in order to protect people from illegal deportations from Hungary and Serbia and managed to ensure fair and equitable proceedings before the competent institutions.<br><br>Over the past ten years, we have legally informed more than 220,000 migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, about their rights and obligations in the country in which they are located. We lawfully advised more than 23,600 asylum seekers and represented them in asylum and other proceedings, as well as before Misdemeanor, Administrative, Constitutional Courts and other instances.<br><br>Our psychologists advised and empowered more than 7,000 asylum-seekers and refugees who needed help - through social assistance, and workshops, we advised more than 3900 asylum seekers.<br><br>We have held over 937 different workshops (cultural, creative, empowering, health, language, school preparatory, and integration, psychological) with more than 4000 asylum seekers taking part in our activities.<br><br>We have crossed over 400,000 kilometers with our mobile teams across Serbia.<br><br>Our web pages were visited by more than 180,000 different people this year alone. During the 2015 refugee crisis, the Center had legally advised more than 110 000 refugees, more than 31 000 children and more than 30 000 women. APC / CZA has trained and taught practices of how to work with children and vulnerable groups, to more than 100 interns and young professionals from the country and abroad.<br><br>APC / CZA has the first and only accredited training programs for social workers in the social welfare system as well as an accredited training program for professional staff in the education system in the field of migrant / asylum / refugee work with a special emphasis on minors.<br><br>We have built a volunteer network with over 170 volunteers.<br><br>Today in Serbia there is no other organization working with refugees where one of its employees has not undergone training, professional development or had a job at with Asylum Protection Center.<br><br>We are particularly proud of our work related to informing the local community about refugees and migrants - people who have fled from war, persecution, poverty, who have come from various cultures, while at the same time informing the migrants about Serbian culture, customs and the rules of their new environment surroundings.<br><br>With all of what we have done and of course what has been done by the state and its institutions, who have a primary duty to manage and care about migration, enough has yet to be done to confidently say that the situation with refugees in Serbia is at a good place.<br><br>Currently there are far more than 5000 migrants in Serbia, of which up to 4000 are housed in reception centers, while others are in the open, in forests, in suburbs, abandoned buildings or in alternative accommodation. The Balkan route is formally closed, but dozens of people continue to enter the country from Bulgaria and Macedonia every day, while in Vojvodina the largest number has accumulated near the borders of Croatia, Hungary and Romania.<br><br>Illegal deportation of people from Croatia, Hungary and Romania to Serbia is a continuous and illegal practice, and people have been illegally pushed back to Serbia, even in instances when they had not previously travelled through the country.<br><br>This brings Serbia into the position of becoming a buffer zone for migration and as a new hotspot on the migration route, which ultimately leads to extensive and far-reaching consequences for the future.<br><br>The longer retention of these people in Serbia and their increasingly difficult transition into EU countries, if that is their goal, requires a change in approaching this problem.<br><br>Migrants currently have difficulty accessing accommodation and asylum procedures, and registration. They are violated of their fundamental rights as asylum seekers in fair and fast procedures, free legal aid, freedom of movement. This places a vulnerable group of people who are often exposed to abuse and violence more and more, in situations of prejudice and prevents integration and interaction with the local environment, and community while promoting the use of smuggling and crime.<br><br>These circumstances require a greater engagement by our organization in informing migrants and providing legal protection to asylum seekers and refugees in proceedings before all institutions, bodies and courts of the Republic, as well as monitoring the application of regulations and behavior on the ground through the process\' of border monitoring and abuse.<br><br>It is very important that our organization keeps its independence, professional and objective approach to problems, while continuing to cooperate with the media to objectively inform citizens and the public while continuing our fight against prejudice and disinformation.<br><br>APC / CZA will continue to train and provide professional practices for young professionals with its accredited training programs for civil servants while working intensively with local communities.<br><br>APC / CZA will furthermore continue its engagement in the integration of those who have received asylum in Serbia, as well as in supporting the system itself and pushing for the improvement of existing practices, and cooperation in the region. As well, our team will work with secular organizations at the European level who will also be a priority in the fight against prejudices, and in raising public awareness of these problems, in building solidarity and permanent networks of cross-border cooperation between organizations in Europe.',

The people surrendered their lives to Jesus and Peter said, “This promise is for you, for your family and for those who are far off.”<br>That is the mission of District Church. Each one of us at some point were far from God, didn’t have it all together, and still the promise of forgiveness and the hope of having a life-giving relationship with Jesus, were for us. The same is true for your life. There’s nothing in your life, that you’ve done, that could keep you from the love of Jesus.',

      "Taliin Tuurai or (Steppe and Hoof) is a non-profit organization which has been set up to help herders and their animals in Mongolia. From a total population of 3.2 million Mongolian people, only about 169,000 nomadic families remain today. Mongolian herders are one of the last group of the pastural nomads left on earth. For a millennium these nomads have lived on the steppes, grazing their animals on vast grasslands while passing their culture virtually unchanged from generation to generation. But today, their traditional lifestyle is under threat. Climate change, desertification and rapidly evolving economics inside of Mongolia are contributing not only to a dramatic reduction in herders and arable land, but also to the rapid migration of families away from their life in the countryside to the cities. For the last several decades thousands of herder families have moved to the cities. Life in the countryside can be harsh. A particularly bad winter, called a Dzud in Mongolian, is an extreme weather phenomenon which regularly results in massive livestock deaths which in turn forces herders to abandon their nomadic way of life to look for work in the cities. With already very high unemployment, job prospects in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar are very few, often forcing these once proud and independent people into poverty in the ger districts surrounding the city. The ger districts have almost no modern services like running water and basic infrastructure.<br>Our goal is to try to save the unique traditions that are part of the Mongolian nomadic lifestyle. With our programs we are striving to preserve the unique tradition and culture that existed for so long in Mongolia while giving herders modern tools, services and training to make it possible for them to succeed in today's world.",

Researchers from the University of Vermont concluded that the role of whales in the ecosystem is so significant, that their recovery can help reduce the impacts of climate change.

The Association Heart for Kids with Cancer was founded in 2003 with a mission of creating best practices and opportunities in treating and supporting pediatric cancer patients and cancer survivors, as well as providing professional and financial help to children with cancer and their parents in Bosnia and Herzegovina. To this day, our ultimate focus has remained the same: providing help and support to pediatric cancer patients, survivors and their families.<br><br>Our organization has been steadily developing ever since its inception. In 2016 we have built The Parents' House, a modern residential building with 10 apartments located on the premises of the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo, which provides housing for children undergoing therapy and their families. The Parents' House functions as a separate and independent project of our Association, and is financed solely through our fundraising activities. This has solved a major problem in our field of work, as the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo does not have means of accommodating parents of children undergoing therapy, most of which come from areas outside of Sarajevo. <br><br>We document and closely monitor all our activities. As we are in a constant and direct contact with our clients, their feedback provides a valuable source of information for us. We use questionnaires, evaluation forms and pre/post interviews to derive quantitative and qualitative indicators in order to measure a relative success of our initiatives. All our activities are meticulously planned in advance, and monitored and evaluated along the way and retroactively. We rely extensively on short term and long term strategic planning to set the goals and objectives, and to determine the best way we use resources to tackle problems or exploit opportunities. <br><br>Since all our operations are funded through fundraising activities and institutional and individual donations, we have put a special emphasis on transparency. We conduct external financial audits and employ independent consultants for all issues of any degree of sensitivity. We are proud to boldly claim that, on account of our dedication, achievements, and our meticulous approach to work, we enjoy a complete and unreserved trust of our clients, governmental institutions and the general public in Bosnia and Herzegovina.",

      "With regard to TCKN's Montessori school, named Lilliput World, our mission is to nurture the younger generation of pre-school age and stimulate their curiosity as they develop a love of learning and a commitment to values while realising their individual potential with the dynamic support of parents as fellow members of the learning community.  The school's motto is Learn, Understand and Grow. <br><br>Our Aims are:<br> Creating a top quality educational and development environment for all children in Lilliput World with a focus on a values-based learning environment, intellectual and personal development and harmony with the natural world.<br> Walking together with children as their companions as they grow and develop, supporting them to make the most of the gifts they were born with.<br> Providing a nourishing, safe and loving environment in which children may explore, experience, express and deepen their own values and character while learning about and cultivating their sense of identity and the nation's cultural values.<br> Strengthening practical and everyday life skills through routines and classroom activities so as to support the development of each child's independence and self-confidence from an early age.<br> Providing balanced, continuous and appropriate basic stimulation to create a strong foundation for the next level of education.<br> Creating a supportive space in which parents and teachers are partners and companions with each other and students as they are learning and playing so that students receive social and emotional support from parents.<br><br>With regard to TCKN's adult classes, in particular our Nusantara International Hospitality Courses, our mission is to provide practical and experiential learning opportunities for the benefit of those otherwise challenged to afford them, recognising that education is the key to the realisation of individual potential and the socio-economic development and progress of each community.  <br><br>The rationale for this is that people do not need to be defined, or limited, by their socio-economic background; with drive, talent, determination and a little support they can achieve wonders.  Empowering education can help them overcome challenges, remove some of the barriers to progress and prosperity potential and flourish.  A major issue that holds back many younger people is the lack of access to the chance to learn skills, acquire knowledge and build capabilities that will enable them to lead productive, meaningful, creative and autonomous lives.  TCKN seeks to address this need by offering low-cost learning opportunities, with a focus on practical and vocational knowledge and skills for the growing hospitality and tourism sectors of the economy.  The motto for our adult education classes is Learning for a Better Life.",

The family pays half the school fees and Educare Fund pays the balance. This is to make sure that the famlilies retain a stake in the education of the girls we support. We feel very strongly about this parnership as we feel it reinforces self-determination locally. The principal goal is the further empowerment of women in Lesotho so that they can play a part in society with greater confidence. Although the current focus is high schoool education which is often a stumbling block for some girls from poor families who do not qualify for govenment support, the charity would like to be in a position to offer scholarships for college and university level.',

      "Forgotten Animals is the closest to being an ASPCA for Russia as it gets. Neglecting and abusing dogs, cats and wild animals, and treating them as commodities, is still a widely common cultural norm in former Soviet countries. There are hundreds of traveling dolphinaria, animal circuses, petting zoos and no wildlife sanctuary to rescue those animals to.<br><br>When you find animals in need, there is usually nowhere to take them, no number to call for help, like there is in the western countries. There is no supporting infrastructure and unless you can afford to take the animal to the vet, pay the bills and look for a new home, there is usually nothing you can do, besides just watching them suffer.<br><br>We are changing the culture where people treat animals as things that are there for them to keep or use as entertainment until it suits them, and to get rid of, when they’ve had enough of them, often inhumanely kill or simply abandon.<br><br>Forgotten Animals does this through:<br>1. Neutering of cats and dogs, reducing the number of unwanted litters and abandonment.<br>2. Making veterinary services available where there are none and helping create and sustain the needed infrastructure<br>3. Educating the population through social ads and humane education<br>4.Lobbying for a legislation change, including drafting a variety of actual law proposals<br>5.Rehabilitating orphaned bear cubs and releasing them back to the wild<br>6. In 2021 we will start building the country's first real wildlife sanctuary, where we can rescue abused wild animals to and finally start shutting down the industries, that are torturing animals for profit and so-called entertainment.<br><br>The work we do alleviates and prevents suffering and deaths and improves the lives of animals and people. Instead of merely fighting the consequences, Forgotten Animals targets the root causes by bringing the best practice and expertise from around the world to remote places in need. With deep understanding of the local culture and mentality and by keeping our overheads low, we work efficiently and effectively, where it is needed the most.",

      'We are an institution founded in 1953, in Mexicali BC, Mexico, under the direction of the Trinitarian Sisters, we serve girls and young women who have been abused or are at risk in their communities. We focus in offering them protection, safeguarding their dignity and rights while giving them the opportunity to make a change in their lives. <br>Our mission is to be an open door to hope, giving girls and young women the opportunity of a new life. WELCOMING without condition, ORIENTING those who are confused, LOOKING for those who are lost, CELEBRATING their achievements, TEACHING the path that leads them to their own fulfillment and happiness, FREEING them from any slavery, LIFTING UP those who have fallen, ACCOMPANYING them in their fight to regain their dignity and SENDING them to announce the good news of their lives. <br>We make them feel loved and respected. We teach them values by setting the example: honesty, integrity, humility, empathy, respect, tolerance, patience, truthfulness, responsibility, discipline, and hard work are some of which we practice.<br>Our Vision is to be a home with appropriate and dignified spaces that allow the practice of the necessary activities and programs where the girls can discover the treasure that they carry within, we do this by helping them maximize their potential by discovering their talents and capabilities so they can achieve social re-integration when they are ready to leave our home.<br>During their time in our school the girls continue their education and receive professional psychological attention. We work in conjunction with institutions in the area with whom we have agreements that certify that the girls have comply with the Government Educational requirements.<br>Some girls are allowed to attend school out of our home, others receive home schooling, either because they are behind their regular school grade or need special attention. That is why we also offer government approved home education programs. We follow up with each case until the girls succeed and get their school diploma.<br>To assure the girls not only have an academic development, we also offer different workshops so they can have an alternative career path when leaving the house, they can choose between, Cosmetology, Seamstress, and Artisanship. They also learn English and take IT courses.<br>We are very proud to be able to say that over the years we have rescued from the streets over 320 girls, we have formed more than 70 community leaders and over 50 of our girls have been able to form their own family.',

      'Improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable groups of society (elderly, people with disabilities, women) through providing basic necessities and medical, social and spiritual assistance.<br><br>Neoumanist Association provides residential care, home visits and day treatment to over one hundred elderly in the district of Straseni in the Republic of Moldova.  Our beneficiaries are typically impoverished, vulnerable, and without family support and many of them are chronically ill and homebound.  The Neoumanist Association serves the most vulnerable groups in the community (especialy the elderly and disabled) with the following goals:   to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable groups in Moldova,   to help the community respect and value humanity,  to help people attain harmony and  a decent standard of living. The "Neoumanist" Association  for Education is  a  NGO (non-governmental organization) that was registered in the Republic of Moldova in November 2000 by the Ministry of Justice.  Since 2003 AE Neoumanist has established four major projects:  1. Rasarit Day Care Centre in the rural town of Straseni, in 2003   2. Spectru Home for senior citizens in the rural town of Straseni, in 2005   3. Home Care serving the outlying villages of Straseni district,  in 2007  4. Mobile Meals for the neediest elderly, in 2012. Each of these projects provides high quality services and assistance to socially vulnerable elderly people in Straseni and Straseni district.  The basic features characterizing the target group are: 1. Compromised psychological health as a result of untreated depression, feelings of despair and hopelessness, and lack of social interaction and loneliness; gender and ethnic discrimination. 2. Malnutrition caused by insufficient income with the attendant inability to purchase nutritious, high-caloric foods, as well as the great difficulty of obtaining and preparing food because of physical disability or other deficiencies; 3. Unsanitary living conditions resulting, again, from insufficient income to purchase cleaning and hygiene supplies and the difficulty of obtaining and utilizing these supplies because of physical disability or other deficiencies. Neoumanist Association understands that, in order to truly help seniors live rich and full lives, we must assist them in satisfying their basic needs before they can attend to issues of justice, equality, and fairness. Through the provision of socio -medical services and supplementary social activities to disadvantaged seniors, Neoumanist strives to promote social and gender equity in Moldova.  A person living in extreme poverty, without adequate food or shelter, cannot effectively participate in civil society. Through meeting  those basic needs, we enable them to become, in time, more engaged and vocal participants within their communities.',

      'C-Libre was established in June 2001, after a series of violations of freedom of expression and the right to information that culminated in the dismissal of several independent journalists, which led to a complaint by the country before the Office of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom. of Expression of the Organization of American States (OAS), a body that responded by calling attention to the worrying situation of the Honduran press. This documented and formal complaint is the antecedent to the annual reports that would later make known the work of the organization. We advocate for the defense and promotion of the right to freedom of expression and access to information as fundamental rights for the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law. C-Libre is a human rights organization that advocates for the defense and promotion of the right to freedom of expression and access to information in Honduras, as fundamental rights for the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law. C-Libre was created as a response to the concerns shared by a group of journalists when public and private power sectors promoted policies and mechanisms that threatened the professional practice of journalists and violated the constitutional precepts that guarantee the free emission of thought. Those of us who make up C-Libre are convinced that in the construction of a rule of law, the existence of an ethical, investigative journalism, an oversight of public management, that works in an environment of security and free access to information, is essential and that promote a public opinion regime that enforces your Right to Information: http://www.clibrehonduras.com<br><br>For 20 years C-Libre has been working to strengthen networks, groups and individual journalists, social communicators and spokespersons to raise awareness about freedom of expression and the press, as well as citizen protest. In the last 10 years, the creation and implementation of regulations that restrict the dissemination and access to information has been increasing, since the approval of the Special Law on the Intervention of Private Communications "Law of Wiretapping", passing through "Law of Secrets "," Law of the National Security and Defense Council "and the" Intelligence Law "among a myriad of information reservation resolutions that contravene the Law of Transparency and Access to Public Information, the instruments and international agreements on transparency and accountability, the Honduran government has accumulated a legal framework that legitimizes and legalizes the culture of secrecy and state opacity, opening the possibility of increasing levels of corruption and impunity, mainly of public officials and employees. <br><br>The technical team is made up of specialists in various areas of knowledge, mainly communication, social, legal and administrative sciences. Likewise, there is the collaboration of volunteers at the national level, who carry out work within the organization as columnists, reporters, compilers among others. Its function is through 4 programmatic areas : Communications, Access to Justice, Knowledge Management and Self-sustainability, which interact to execute the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan. Currently, C-Libre has 10 people who make up the organization who work full time. The direction of the organization is mainly in charge of the Executive Directorate, who must work together with the President of the Board of Directors. The organization\'s performance is supervised by the Board of Directors, and this responsibility falls much more strongly on the President and the Supervisory Board, made up of the Treasury and 2 more members of the Board of Directors. Annual reports are submitted to the Board of Directors and the Assembly of the organization, financial and technical reports that are also sent to the pertinent government bodies. In addition, once a week the technical team meets to plan the week\'s activities, as well as discuss topics of interest to the organization, annually the assembly and the board of directors meet to render annual reports and every 2 years for the election. of a new Board of Directors.',

      'Vusumnotfo  is a Swazi Not-for-Profit organization whose formation was authorized by community leaders in northern Eswatini  following the 1991/92 drought.  These leaders identified "dependency"  as the underlying factor limiting sustainable development  at community level. They attributed the deep roots of "dependency" to be interwoven issues specific to Eswatini and the region. To reverse this negative cycle of "dependency" in ways relevant to their communities, they formed Vusumnotfo .  Accordingly our strategy reflects Eswatini\'s many proverbs that the betterment of the future is through the child - "Umntfwana ngumliba loya embili".<br><br>Our rationale is based on a large body of international research, also reflected in this traditional wisdom. During the period between prenatal through the first nine years, a child develops the physical, emotional, language, communication, cognitive, social, and value structures that lay the foundation for their lifetime. <br><br>In these early years, a child naturally depend on adults to nurture their development and learning needs (dependency stage). If adults are not able to do so, a child\'s development and learning falls behind. Consequently, this child will have limitations to overcome, some of which are insurmountable, setting up a negative cycle of dependency.   <br><br>Conversely, a child who achieves early developmental milestones and learning standards has the fundamentals for attaining the skills to meet their own needs as adults (independency stage) and, thereafter, to nurture the needs of the next generation (inter-dependency stage).   <br><br>Our goal is to strengthen skills at family and community level in practices that support the development and learning of young children, as a strategy to build human capacity. Overtime, building human capacity results in families able and willing to nurture the next generation, and communities able and willing to improve environmental, social and economic challenges, setting up a positive cycle of sustainable development.  Thus "parenting" contributes to the wellbeing of this generation, and nurtures the next generation; hence - Parenting for a Sustainable Future.™<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>VUSUMNOTFO - Parenting for a Sustainable Future™<br><br>Our Aim - To strengthen skills at family and community level, in practices that advance child development and learning, in 17 Swazi communities<br><br>Our Motto  - Do what you can, with what you have, now',

      'Autistic individuals are characterized by disorders of varying degrees of communication skills, social interactions and limited, stereotyped patterns of behavior.<br>They are a "mosaic" of strengths, deficits and deviations. Sociocommunicative problematic is often combined with intellectual<br>deficit, with delay in language development, with deficit of control on impulses and hyperactivity. Parents are also different resources (emotional, family, support systems) to cope with the social trauma inflicted on them.<br>That\'s why we chose for ours:<br>Mission:<br>Especially important for people with developmental disabilities is, to have equal opportunities for development, equal chances for a dignified and independent life.<br>Main goal:<br>Bridging deficits through services, developing personal potential, consistent with the individual needs of everyone.<br>A bit of our history:<br>In 2011, parents of autistic individuals, friends and like-minded people, we established the Developmental Disabilities Foundation to improve the quality of life of individuals with developmental disabilities.<br>Everything we do is to overcome the consequences of social trauma for persons with developmental problems and their relatives. By providing social services in the community, we aim to build self-reliance skills that promote social inclusion.<br>We hold licenses for: therapy and rehabilitation; community work; training for the acquisition of work skills; support for the acquisition of work skills; informing and consulting; advocacy and mediation and day care.<br>Each person is unique and has the right to happiness, equal opportunities to achieve it, equal chances for a dignified and independent life.<br>That is why we created and are developing the Center for inclusive and non-formal education "Art and Jump". In the informal space of the Workshop, children and young people learn through experiences while working and having fun in the Wool and Textiles workshop, the Ceramics workshop and the Digital Competences workshop.<br>We implement an innovative program of creative educational modules that develops cognitive skills, promotes personal development and increases motivation to face everyday challenges.<br>As a team, we are clearly aware of social dignity and responsibility. Therefore, we strive for the formation of empathy, tolerance and acceptance of one\'s own and others\' "differences" in the spirit of respect for human dignity and value in society.<br>"Being different is a privilege"<br>Autistic individuals need a variety of appropriate forms of support throughout their lives. Therefore, it is necessary to develop and implement individual projects for independent living for each of them. Our foundation pays the necessary attention to the group dynamics in order to build an interpersonal relationship and at the same time relationships in the social environment.<br>We all know that in Bulgaria there is no network organization of services for people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) at all ages. Therefore, one of the guiding principles in the management of our organization is to ensure the continuity of services for children, youth and adults.<br>We are currently working with the Autism - Education, Future and Opportunities Association. Combining ideas, resources and tools, we have found an appropriate solution to the problem of the "child with autism in secondary school" challenge. We support the Association in their activities for the introduction of the Competent Learner (CLM) model.<br>In the House we will further develop and upgrade the model "Workshop for the development of cognitive skills and increase the capacity for autonomy", as well as Dance-Motor Therapy for Psychosomatic Development, which we are currently implementing under the Program of Sofia Municipality for Social Innovations. We will apply innovative management, continuously and long-term, so that we can simultaneously meet social needs and create new social relationships and cooperation.<br>Working with parents and siblings is another key moment in our planned activities. The effect of therapies and rehabilitation for people with developmental problems is insufficient if it is not integrated with psycho-social interventions with the whole family.<br>Another important goal of ours is the creation of supported employment, employment support, and social enterprise for our users. We already have a working creative studio in ceramics, Art and Jump Workshop. We plan to develop resilience and create work skills in the field of applied arts for young people with disabilities.',

Finding solutions that break the poverty cycle and create healthy resilient communities are ultimately solutions that link these individuals and communities back to their wildlife heritage and the jobs/opportunities created in the wildlife and tourism economy. Especially in the area of Acornhoek, Mpumalanga, where we focus our projects, there is a huge amount of poaching which is a conservation issue, but also a huge amount of poverty, as this is a neglected and under served area/community in South Africa. Solutions aimed at linking and bridging the two are the only way for this area to have a sustainable future. This is where Nourish focuses it's projects; investing into sustainable livelihoods that will benefit communities and conservation, boosting their resilience.",

With over 40% of care leavers being NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) and about half of them suffering from mental health disorder, care leavers present a highly vulnerable but also hugely neglected group within our society.<br><br>Our approach is based on the belief that meaningful employment and a career path of the individual's own choice, can help young people overcome the hurdles in front of them and create a better future for themselves. Our employment consultants therefore work with our clients on a 1-2-1 basis, providing guidance and support around planning a career and moving into independence. Also, our training sessions focus on improving employability, presentation and public speaking skills on the one hand, and increasing individuals' confidence, motivation and basic communication skills on the other. Our corporate partners and special relationships to top employers in London further enable us to offer exclusive employment opportunities, internships and work experience to the young people working with us. Running interview preparation sessions and CV masterclasses, as well as donation their skills and time as mentors, their staff further support individuals to achieve their career goals.<br><br>Those four components, 10201 support + bespoke training + opportunities + mentoring, add up to a holistic approach, enabling care leavers to actively start shaping their own futures.",

IsraAID's first team arrived on the ground 4 days after the tsunami, and distributed aid, cleaned houses, created child-friendly spaces, and rebuilt schools. During this period, IsraAID discovered a rapidly growing need for psycho-social and post-traumatic care, and has decided to launch the \"Japan IsraAID Support Program (JISP)\" in August 2013. Drawing on local and foreign knowledge, IsraAID and JISP have provided direct support to the victims and trained thousands of professionals and care providers in MHPSS, offering PTSD prevention, stress-management and leadership workshops.<br>Founded in the aftermath of the great disaster in Tohoku, JISP now operates as one of the leading humanitarian organizations based in Japan's Tohoku Region where very few international NGOs activate.",

The founders of HDI were born and raised in remote areas of Eastern and Central Africa, where simple, preventable diseases claimed many lives--especially those of women and children. Because of this, the founders were inspired to become healthcare professionals and work towards improving the health and well-being of their communities.  <br><br>In 2005, HDI was born of a common passion to improve the accessibility of quality healthcare for all Rwandans, particularly marginalized populations whose needs remain under-served. The organization began by empowering individuals with basic knowledge and skills in prevention and treatment methods in the hope that one day all Rwandan citizens may lead healthy lives, free from preventable disease and premature mortality. In this spirit, HDI promotes sustainable, community-based interventions such as disease prevention, health training, and capacity building at both the individual and institutional level. <br><br>Today, HDI brings together a team with vast experience in medicine, public health, and community development to bridge the gap between communities and the health care system. Our mission is to promote community-based healthcare and development in Rwanda. We work to educate communities on health practices, empower providers to deliver better health services, and build sustainable alliances between communities and healthcare professionals.  Using a rights-based approach, we advocate for quality healthcare for disadvantaged and marginalized groups. Through education and improved healthcare capacity, we seek to bridge the healthcare inequalities in our country.',

      "Our mission is to help. Help children who truly need us. We've started this project years ago and put in all of our soul, heart, energy and professionalism. Our last project, however, is different! Different in scale, duration, direction. If we want to successfully keep it on we need the help of many more people and make them stand behind our idea. So we dream and we hope that this pilot initiative will become a mission of the whole society. With joint efforts, new ideas and forms we hope to achieve results which affect society, the economy and the state.<br><br>After 13 years of working with disadvantaged children we came to the conclusion that about 40% of adolescents among them have intellectual potential well above average, and every second child has a brilliant talent or gift.<br><br>Thus, the project School of Arts and Crafts for Socially Disadvantaged Children was born . Generally our mission is:<br><br>    To provide an opportunity for talented and gifted children to receive free quality education and upbringing.<br>    Help to maintain, develop and improve their natural potential and turn it into a capital for their future;<br>    To provide an individual approach and professional care, excellent facilities and environment filled with comfort, peace and love;<br>    To promote the growth of good and smart people motivated and confident to realize their professional and life start;<br>    To provide the best team of teachers, mentors, experts and inspiring artists who lead children to self-knowledge and self-expression.<br><br> <br><br>In fact, our most important mission is to have many, many smiles on the faces of the children! Being happy with everything that happens to them and around them, feeling comfortable in their growth and confident that after graduating  from our school they have the knowledge and skills necessary  to  hold the future in their hands.",

      'Sistema Cyprus is a social-music orchestra programme established in 2017. Sistema Cyprus provides accessible music education to the children and young people of Cyprus, including migrants, refugees and disadvantaged children and young people, and ensures that these disadvantaged groups are respected, recognised, and included in the society. Sistema Cyprus is an El Sistema inspired social action music programme that was first founded in Venezuela in 1975.<br>Currently, Sistema Cyprus operates in Nicosia and Larnaca and engages 200 children and young people in orchestra, choir and community music activities, through the work of 15 professional musicians, 20 musician volunteers and the support of 80 program support volunteers. Sistema Cyprus expertise includes community music education and musical instrument teaching to vulnerable populations through a methodology that is adjusted to the model of developing a learning environment based on safety, inclusion, and equality. Finally, Sistema Cyprus is an expert in training young people to use music for promoting social inclusion for refugee, migrant and disadvantaged children and young people. <br>Sistema Cyprus works to educate and empower marginalized populations, providing them with opportunities for social inclusion and broadening the visibility of their success stories. Through our social music programme, we strive to offer a better life opportunity to marginalized children who are often feeling unwelcome from belonging to the society that they live in.<br>El Sistema and other related El Sistema programs offer free classical music education that gives impoverished children and youth all over the world the opportunity for personal development. Sistema Cyprus is focused on the personal development of its participants focusing primarily on empowerment and reaching their potentials. Through the formation of orchestras and choirs, El Sistema acts as a superb model, reaching children and young people to many of the world\'s underprivileged neighbourhoods.<br>Our main activities include daily practice of instrumental learning, orchestra and choir rehearsals where every child or young people is in Sistema Cyprus for 5 hours per week.

In the late '80s, when Philip Smith and his father, Jack, first heard about the plight of Brazil's street children, off-duty police were becoming after-dark death squads, systematically exterminating thousands of the \"public nuisances\" for local business owners.  Fortunately, the government was able get a handle on the situation.  But for a child on the streets, the children's life expectancy still amounts to three to five years.<br><br>An estimated 7 to 8 million Brazilian children are on the streets - living, breathing refuse of desperately poor homes, where parents have turned to drugs, alcohol, and crime.  And this is the world of Hope Unlimited - organized in 1991 to reclaim and parents the lost children of Brazil.<br><br>Over the past 30 years, reaching deeply into one life at a time, Hope Unlimited has directly touched the lives of over 24,000 children - including their next generations.

Over 600 kids are also bussed in everyday from the surrounding slums to participate in our Vocational Training program.  When Hope succeeds, the cycle is broken: a child grows up to become a productive and contributing member of society.  Even more importantly, they have become loving and Godly parents.  Fully 92% of the boys and girls who completed the residential program at Hope Unlimited are employed today.",

      "The Women Inspiration Development Center (WIDC) is an initiative designed to create a safe place for Nigerian women and girls in challenging life circumstances to envision and create new possibilities for their lives, families and communities. <br><br>WIDC is committed to advancing women's right and creating a refuge for victims of gender based violence and disenfranchised women and girls. Through agency-based empowerment, WIDC supports these women and girls as they improve their health, economic well-being and social status, leading fulfilling lives free of violence. We believe in the inherent potential and ability of every woman to overcome obstacles, take control of her life, emerge confident and strong, and make meaningful contributions to her society. <br><br>WIDC was formed in 2009 by Busayo Obisakin along with a group of women friends and colleagues. Initially they called themselves Vigilantes against Violence and set out to curb the violence against women and girls through a variety of services and activities they offered throughout the local community. After a short while, it became clear that the name needed to change to reflect the widening scope of the work done by the group to help protect and improve the lives of women in the community. The group officially became registered as an organization, Women Inspiration Development Center, in 2010.  <br><br>Mission: To improve the health, economic, and social status of Nigerian women and girls in order to empower them to lead fulfilling lives free of violence. <br><br>Vision:  We envision a Nigeria where women and girls are empowered and they create new possibilities for themselves without fear or intimidation.",

Our network works together to create what we call a solidarity economy: a local rural economy in which different parts of society work equitably together to create prosperity and well-being for all. Our vision is to build the strength of community organizations, committed to integral local and national development, who can effectively advocate for economic, social and cultural rights, and ensure dignity and quality of life for all Honduran families.',

    description:
      "Our Mission<br><br>Innovative Young Minds' goal is to expose young women in school years 11 and 12 to career and research opportunities available in STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and high-tech manufacturing) sectors here in New Zealand. IYM seeks to encourage diversity and equality in our science and technology industry by inspiring a new generation of innovators and industry leaders. <br><br>Females are grossly underrepresented in the STEMM sector and we want to change that. For example, only 12% of engineers in New Zealand are currently women. Women also face significant barriers in entering and progressing within the science and technology workforce. Increasing female participation in STEMM will mean greater innovation and economic success for everyone. In the testing times we are currently in, this new breed of creative problem solvers and innovators will be the ones tackling the big challenges of the 21st century such as Covid-19 and climate change.<br><br>We need to inspire talented people to invent new ways of working, living, travelling and making things. To build a better future, the next generation of engineers, scientists, engineers and technicians need to better reflect our diverse society. This is why it is so important to encourage more young women to get involved in science and technology. <br><br>New Zealand is home to brilliant and passionate young women. We know this because 370 of them have participated in IYM's programmes. These young women give us hope for the future. IYM's mission is to break down barriers and encourage young women to enter the STEMM sector and to do so we must ensure that our programmes are as engaging and accessible as possible. <br><br>Our programmes are run by a small but passionate team made up of our five dedicated board members, who come from within our local business and council networks, and one very hard working part time operational staff member.  Despite the small team, we're working hard to make a difference to the young women in New Zealand by providing fit-for-purpose locally-based programmes so that we can invigorate our future STEMM labour market.<br><br>How Covid-19 changed our programmes<br>When Covid-19 arrived in 2020, it changed everything for IYM. We were unable to run our normal residential programmes and in response, we created a purpose built online programme that could be delivered to a larger number of students across New Zealand.  Delivered virtually via Zoom and Google Classroom, the programme was hugely successful demonstrating there was a strong demand for an accessible online programme. This year our online programme was held in the April school holidays and nearly 100 young women from across New Zealand participated in it.<br><br>Creating an engaging and participatory virtual programme from scratch in a short time had its challenges but the feedback we received from students told us we were on the right track.  We incorporated virtual site tours, compelling and inspirational speakers, mentoring sessions and the Innovation Challenge which is the highlight of every programme we run. The participant fee was only $30 including GST per person which ensured the programme was accessible to all.<br><br>We were lucky to have Covid-19 relatively well under control in New Zealand by mid 2021 so we were able to proceed with both the new online programme AND our original residential programme, just with a few tweaks; this year we made the decision to only open the residential programme to students in the Greater Wellington Region (rather than the whole country) as this meant that we could more easily manage the financial risks associated with further Covid-19 related lockdowns.   This programme was held in the July 2021 school holidays and 39 young women from high schools from the Greater Wellington Region took part.<br><br>During the week-long residential programme, students attended site visits at universities, Crown Research Institutes and other STEMM organisations where they took part in a range of hands-on STEMM activities. During the programme, students also  interacted with women from the science and technology  sector who shared their personal journeys and experiences, completed an innovation challenge over the week and learned to network with industry representatives. Students also joined sponsors, business representatives and participants from across the programme at a formal parliamentary reception to finish the week.  Thanks to the generosity of our funders, participants only pay $170 including GST per person and successful applicants pay this fee once they are accepted onto the programme.<br><br>On both our online and residential programmes, participants experience the following:<br>- Tours of laboratories and other spaces in universities, Crown Research Institutes and businesses.<br>- Interactive sessions where researchers and innovators showcase their research and work.<br>- Inspiring career sessions led by women working in STEMM.<br>- Team-building and networking sessions.<br>- An Innovation Challenge where participants work in teams led by industry expert mentors.<br><br>Accessibility is key to our success<br>We know that there are numerous barriers that stop students, and particularly young females from experiencing STEMM opportunities.  Some of these include where they live, family life, expectations and responsibilities, and financial barriers. Our goal is to reduce as many of these barriers as possible so that at least 140 young New Zealand female students per year get the opportunity to experience STEMM careers that might spark their interest for the future. <br><br>Whilst our programmes have been through a period of growth and change since IYM's inception in 2017, we have never been afraid of making changes, for the right reasons. So far we have delivered once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunities for over 370 young women from years 11 and 12 and with additional funding and support we know that we can make this even more impactful and ultimately extend our impact even further.<br><br>The Innovation Challenge<br>The Innovation Challenge aspect of the programme is immensely successful as it encourages teamwork, friendship, collaboration, problem-solving and design-thinking skills. It also develops research skills and builds confidence as participants deliver presentations back to their peers.<br><br>We'd like to grow this into The 3M Innovation Challenge so that more young women can participate, learn and benefit from the experience.  We know it is life changing, can lead to friendships and gives students the confidence they might need to pursue their passion for a STEMM career - or at the very least give new opportunities a go.<br><br>The Innovation Challenge allows students to:<br>- Investigate the Challenge.<br>- Choose enabling technologies and design a solution using these.<br>- Make a quick prototype of their solution.<br>- Present their solution.<br>- Celebrate success in a supportive team environment.<br><br>\"If these young women keep up the confidence and motivation I saw, our future is going to benefit from a fabulous generation of problem-solvers\". <br>Innovation Challenge 2021 judge Vanessa Oakley, General Manager, Strategy & Business Operations, Chorus<br><br><br> \"I found it inspiring to see the environmental solutions that the young women in this years' IYM cohort developed during the Innovation Challenge and the poise with which they presented their ideas. Young people think of solutions that adults would never dream of. Investing in them might be the key to building a better world\".<br>Innovation Challenge 2021 judge Dr Catlin Powers, Namaste Foundation<br><br>Video links for more information:<br>https://youtu.be/4UjtV94jUkA<br>https://youtu.be/BXw-k5d0MhA<br>https://youtu.be/BlwdpiK-QeI",

      "Child Action is a UK registered charity specialising in education and personal development initiatives in India and the UK.  The charity was founded by entrepreneur Dr Seema Sharma in response to the terrible poverty she witnessed in Mumbai whilst filming a documentary with Channel 4 as part of the Secret Millionaire series, during which she volunteered with several grassroots NGOs in India.  <br><br>Child Action's work reflects our passionate commitment to preventative strategies which ensure that marginalised groups of people living in India are given the help they need to achieve self-reliance and self-sufficiency. <br><br>Together with our three local NGO partners, Doorstep School, Toybank and Apnalaya, we support the development of young people living in extreme poverty by creating learning opportunities for children living within Mumbai's most disadvantaged street and slum communities.<br><br>Our personal relationships with these partner organisations enable us to communicate on a regular basis, ensuring an in-depth understanding of their needs.  We undertake regular project monitoring and work with our partners to produce progress reports.  This alleviates the administrative burden for the grass roots NGOs, maximising the impact of donor funds for our work in India.  <br><br>The work carried out by our partners is having a transformational and long-lasting effect on the lives of children who face the desperately unfair challenge of being born into families facing extreme poverty.",

    description:
      'The REAL SCHOOL is providing its graduates with knowledge (theoretical and practical) and skills (professional, personal and social) to succeed in high-tech innovative industry.<br><br>REAL SCHOOL is a four year collage level program that combines liberal arts in-class education and vocational off-site trainings in R&D organizations, resulting in a level of knowledge comparable to today\'s Bachelor level graduates of Armenian universities combined with practical skills and CV of a 1-year junior developer in modern IT/High-tech company. <br><br>The main difference from classical Bachelors program is targeting professional career in the industry, rather than academic career.  However it doesn\'t mean that the applicants are low-level technicians. Modern high-tech industry requires everyday effort in self-education (lifelong learning) due to constantly changing technologies, innovation, new fields, spheres, opportunities. The modern life is not divided into "learn" and "work" segments anymore, but is combining the work & learning process till the last day of the professional career. <br><br>As a consequence, the classical approach to education (learn only) and to professional career (work only) is failing in XXI century. Our vision of XXI century high-tech organization is a combination of Research, Production and Education formats. An organization that lacks any one of these 3 components, will loose in competition to those who are doing their own innovation, that is close to their own production, and are educating their own staff by maintaining the internship logistics. <br><br>Our mission is to implement such program in partnership with IT organizations in neighborhood of each RealSchool site. It includes expansion to rural areas of developing countries, helping local industry to upgrade to meet the challenges of innovative high-tech economy. <br><br>We have started discussions with Ethiopian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese and US (California) organizations to apply the model in the less fortunate districts, where the schools and the culture in general is unable to meet the challenges of the new age. Such areas and schools can be found even in 50 mile distance from Silicon Valley, therefore this program is not limited to developing countries. <br><br>The liberal arts program is following classical approach to education of a "free citizen" of a republic, i.e. provide understanding of the structure of the world, universe, civilization, economy, which is sufficient for the person to discover their mission for their life or at least for the next 7-12 years, and to develop their skills and knowledge towards fulfillment of that mission. <br><br>The liberal arts program itself is built in a project-based approach. The projects used in this section of the curriculum are also real-life projects, i.e. they are not invented by professors for educational purposes but are chosen from the infrastructure projects and issues faced by the region/country/world. <br><br>Examples of such projects for I and II grade students include: <br><br>1) Forest recovery, in cooperation with the Armenian Forestry Committee. Green industry projects. Reuse of materials. Effective ovens development. Effective usage of forests/wood in the industry and household. Biodegradable materials development and use in the small scale high-end production.  <br><br>2) Study of ancient Armenian literature, classical Armenian language, terminology, in cooperation with prominent researchers in the field. Creation of fonts, spell-checkers, translators for modern dialects (western/eastern) of Armenian and classical Armenian. Localization of the GNU SW (Firefox, Thunderbird, OpenOffice, Xfce4, Gimp, Inkscape, etc). <br><br>3) Study of ancient musical notation systems and body movement (dance) notation systems, development of SW for musical and ethnographic studies, in cooperation with researches from Armenian Conservatory, institute of Komitas and Armenian song and dance academy. <br><br>4) Study of environmental health control and monitoring, development of measurement kits for air, water, soil and ether (electromagnetic) pollution, performance of the measurements and publication/awareness promotion projects<br><br>5) Study of information management systems, information security challenges, development of national standards for information age, upgrade of national institutions, ministries to reduce paperwork and use modern IT solutions<br><br>6) Study of macroeconomic and microeconomic field, legislation. Development of promotion programs and lobbying for making legislation more friendly towards innovation, startup, family-business and small/medium enterprises.<br><br>7) Study of pedagogical and epistemological issues in high-tech post-modern reality, development of extracurricular and curricular studies for middle-school and high-school students. Support and further development of Armath curriculum, in cooperation with original authors of Armath curicula. Augmenting Armath with radio-frequency, electronics, mechatronics and biochemical kits.<br><br>In the fields of pedagogy and epistemology - the mission is to reconsider foundations of personal training, establishment, attachment and feeling of heartbeat of the civilization, world, universe for a modern human being. From our perspective the history of the epistemology and thought is split into segments of before XIV century (primarily descriptive science), followed by the birth of analytical methods and decomposition, until hitting the ground (subatom, genome, lexical elements) in the mid XX century, and starting the third phase - the age of synthetic science (syntetic materials, synthetic life forms, synthetic languages). At the same time this switch from analytical to synthetical coincided with demographic supernova burst: for ages the population on earth was < 1B, and in XX it jumped to 7B and continues growing. As in the case of supernova - and in general - any bifurcation point - it is hard to predict what will be the next state: the dwarf, black hole, or new star. It is easier to choose desired outcome and invest resources in achieving that outcome, rather than investing in analytical efforts to predict the outcome. <br><br>Fundamental reconsideration of human beings attitude towards self, towards their planet, their civilization and the universe is due to protect new generation from storm of information they are facing from their birth time, and give them instruments to categorize, prioritize and filter that information, in order to extract the core values, build goals and obtain attachment to life that was "given" in in the past to a person by the life style, and now has became a major problem for new generation, which has hard time finding challenges outside the virtual world of social networks and network games.  Parents cannot solve this problem alone. The system needs to be built by the state to help them. Our goal is to provide B2G consulting and active participation in building the new formats and curricula for different age groups. Our consortium has created the Armath program under this mission, is building the Real School program, and has started building the Academic Research Hub for the academic (fundamental research) field as well.  Among these, the RealSchool in mid-term has the highest impact on our future.',

    name: 'Roads to Rehab - Nepal',
    description:
      "Many people living in remote regions of Nepal do not have access to primary healthcare, medical treatment or rehabilitation services. Medical care is not free in Nepal and poverty is widespread. <br><br>Many people travel from remote and regional Nepal to major cities like Kathmandu to access medical care and these people constitute most of MeRO's patients. The remote regions they come from are severely lacking in funding and facilities. Most larger villages have a clinic staffed by a Health Assistant who has done two years of training and can dispense 35 different medications and do basic wound care and vaccinations, but their medical knowledge is poor. Traditional healing is practiced, often with devastating results. There are often no hospitals for anywhere up to a 2 - 3 day walk, or over the years, dirt roads have paved the way for lengthy rough journeys on a local bus. Hospitals may offer only rudimentary services - they often do not have operating theatres, anaesthetists, surgeons or anaesthetic machines, or staff who can use them. Investigative technology and ancillary services like pathology are often basic or non-existent. There are no other options other than travel to Kathmandu or even India (which is cheaper) in search of medical care or a cure for themselves or their loved ones.<br><br>Roads to Rehab Nepal works with Medical Rehabilitation Organisation (MeRO) in Kathmandu. Before January 2022, MeRO was known as Nepal Healthcare Equipment Development Foundation (NHEDF) however they changed their name to better reflect what they actually do today. We have registration with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC). MeRO is registered with the Social Welfare Council in Kathmandu. Our respective registrations gives us accountability and transparency with our Governments, our donors and the general public.<br><br>Our mutual projects encompass many articles of the UN Declaration of Human Rights. We are non-discriminatory; support children, women and men of all ages, castes, religions and ethnic groups; we help alleviate poverty; improve access to health care and advance health; support people with disabilities and their families.<br><br>We have been operating since December 2016 and our mission is to support and work with MeRO. This Social Welfare Council registered non-profit organisation was set up prior to the 2015 earthquake by a biomedical engineer called Samrat, who recycled broken medical equipment for free and gave it back to the hospital or individual in good working order. <br><br>When the earthquake happened, NHEDF was inundated with patients in need of ongoing medical care who were discharged from hospital way too early to make room for more. Their small premises were soon relocated to a larger facility and they operated for 3 months using volunteer staff. Samrat thought the Shelter would only be around for a few months but patients just keep coming to this day. Now they know they are here to stay, especially after COVID!<br><br>Our mission, and theirs, is to provide access to healthcare and improve health outcomes for people who come from remote or regional areas of Nepal and cannot access medical care or rehabilitation services due to poverty. We fund and facilitate medical and surgical intervention, nursing care, physiotherapy and rehabilitation services. Their road to rehabilitation is often long and complex, but between us, we change the lives of people who have no one else to turn to and nowhere else to go.<br><br>Life in Nepal is tough and life for someone with a disability in Nepal is even tougher. People with a disability are generally not treated kindly or compassionately in Nepal. <br><br>When patients are referred to MeRO, they are in desperate circumstances and many are unable to return to their pre-injury employment because of their disability. Alternatively, they may not be able to work because they have spent weeks, or even months, caring for a hospitalised family member.<br><br>MeRO's rents a building in Kathmandu called the Shelter, which accommodates up to 20 patients and their care-giver, usually a family member, as is customary in Nepal. Everything at the Shelter is completely free, thanks to the generosity of donors - accommodation, food, medical and surgical intervention, physiotherapy, rehabilitation services and around-the-clock nursing care. <br><br>The Shelter provides a safe haven in a family focussed environment for people who need their services. MeRO advocates for their patients and helps them navigate the complexities of the expensive, unjust, hospital system. <br><br>Roads to Rehab Nepal funds five things. Firstly, our nurse and physio sponsorship program pays the wages of 3 nurses and a physio who work at the Shelter. This enables around-the-clock nursing care as well as physiotherapy 6 days a week. Secondly, we cover the cost of medical and surgical intervention as required. Thirdly, we pay MeRO's monthly pharmacy bill which covers medications, medical, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy supplies for all patients at the Shelter, as well as rehabilitation aids and equipment. We  fund opportunities for ongoing professional development of MeRO's clinical staff. Finally, as of January 2022, we fund mandatory project monitoring and evaluation activities by the Social Welfare Council. We also mentor and assist MeRO's Board Members with practices and policies that build safe spaces and good governance. We also provide friendship and support.<br><br>The amount of financial support we can give to MeRO is directly related to the number of donations we receive. Likewise, the number of patients MeRO can accept is dependent on their funding.  To this day hospitals, community organisations, other not-for-profit organisations in Nepal and individuals, especially nursing and medical staff, continue to refer more patients to MeRO than they can accept.<br><br>MeRO has tremendous support both from the local community within Nepal and internationally. Patients are often referred to them, usually having incurred huge medical debts. Many of MeRO's patients owe money to family, money lenders and/or their local community and are often homeless and sometimes suicidal. Some patients have spent as much as US$20,000 - $22,500 on medical bills which is almost beyond belief, given that Nepal lies somewhere between the 27th and 30th poorest countries in the world, with up to 25% of its population living below the poverty line.<br><br>Most of MeRO's patients come from rural and remote regions and have often sold all or most of their land which has been in their family for generations in order to pay their medical bills. Other patients keep a small parcel and home is a shack or a tent. Many are homeless.<br><br>Some of MeRO's patients are injured working overseas, usually in Malaysia or the Gulf, and are sent back to Nepal after initial treatment with no compensation. Also, there is no such thing as workers compensation in Nepal. All their savings from working overseas end up going on medical bills. The Government may provide a disability allowance if certain criteria are met, but this is approximately the equivalent of US $44 a month and many hurdles are put in the way which makes it difficult to even apply.<br><br>We also assist women with fistula who are referred to MeRO and usually live in desperate poverty. These women who have experienced catastrophic obstetric injury cannot seek medical attention because they are poor; because knowledge of fistula in Nepal is poor; their injury is often not recognised; they are marginalised, socially isolated, often living in stables or caves having been abandoned by their family and ostracised by their community. <br><br>When patients arrive at MeRO, they find the most suitable medical specialist and hospital in Kathmandu for investigations, appointments and surgery as required. Should surgery be necessary, they are transferred back to NHEDF as soon as they are well enough. Some patients stay only a couple of weeks; others' months, and the occasional patient 1 - 3 years as individual roads to rehabilitation are often long. <br><br>MeRO's patients have all sorts of diagnoses resulting from trauma/injury/illness. Diagnoses range from fractures, soft tissue injury, amputations, wounds, burns, burns contractures, head injuries, neurological conditions and obstetric fistula. Some of our patients may have bone cancer requiring an amputation, extensive rehabilitation and the fitting of unusual prostheses. Occasionally Samrat accepts a patient who is terminally ill who is simply kicked out of hospital because they cannot pay any more and would otherwise be simply left to die. Patients are either referred or simply picked up from hospital foyers where they are found begging for money to pay for their medical care or that of a loved one. <br><br>We welcome the support of the GlobalGiving community.",

    description:
      "We save innocent children, accused of witchcraft, from exclusion, torture and death. With care, protection and education for the children and by educating their surrounding communities, we lay the foundation for a future, where children grow up to be independent, active and social individuals who contribute to the development of their community.<br><br><br>INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS AS THE CATALYSTS OF DEVELOPMENT<br><br>During the last decade, accusations of witchcraft made against Nigerian children have risen alarmingly, especially in the state of Akwa Ibom, where Land of Hope's children's centre is located. The cause of the rise in belief in witchcraft and black magic is a complex mixture of social, economic and religious factors. If we are to combat superstition, we have to tackle the root of the problem, and that lies in the impoverished villages in which Land of Hope runs its information campaigns.  <br><br>Land of Hope works on the conviction that education is of massive importance to the ability of future generations to build a just society. We believe that education is the most effective weapon in the battle against superstition.  <br><br>That's why we invest a lot of time on Advocacy Work in Nigerian, which simply means the spread of information. Advocacy is generally about speaking up on behalf of others to the local and national authorities, to bring them to account and live up to their responsibilities to the poorest groups in society. It's also about helping those groups, so that they know and understand their rights, and can demand that they are fulfilled. Our information campaigns are designed to enhance the process of development and progress in Nigeria that is so necessary to combat superstition.  <br><br><br>WHY CHILDREN ARE ACCUSED OF WITCHCRAFT<br><br>The residents of the poorest areas of Akwa Ibom feel abandoned and marginalised by the government, which does nothing to educate and develop their communities. Schooling for the children is irregular, and superstition is deeply ingrained in African culture, which gives sustenance to jungle law, superstition and ignorance. Families look for an explanation for their poverty, or sudden death, and fear of evil and the supernatural can be so strong that it displaces love for a child, which can quickly be made into a scapegoat. Finally, many of the revivalist churches use superstition for exorcism, which they earn a lot of money for. Local priests are therefore responsible for the majority of witchcraft accusations against children in the state.  <br><br><br>INFORMATION ON CHILDREN'S RIGHTS<br><br>When we visit such areas during our information campaigns, the first thing we seek to do is to create a platform for dialogue, in which we can talk about superstition, the importance of education and the rights of children. For example, few people here are aware that it is actually illegal to accuse a child of witchcraft, and can result in up to 15 years in prison. On the other hand, witchcraft accusations are not a problem the government concerns itself with, even though the Governor of Akwa Ibom made witchcraft accusation a criminal act with the introduction of the 'Child Rights Act' in 2003.  <br><br>There is therefore little help to be gained by pointing an accusing finger at the ignorant villagers, who have been left to their own devices for so long. They are uneducated, and are not even aware of their basic rights. That's why it is important that we also listen to their frustrations, and support their efforts to gain the attention of the government, which is ultimately responsible for generating progress in the areas affected. <br><br><br>HOME VISITS<br><br>An important part of our information campaigns is what we call 'home visits', taking the children to visit their own immediate family. Naturally, they miss their parents, brothers and sisters, and we believe that our most important task is to help them retain close relationships with them. Many people find it hard to understand why it makes sense to take these children back to the village where they were cast out, tortured and left to fend for themselves. But it's very rare that witchcraft accusations come directly from their own parents. When a child is accused of being a witch, the accusation usually comes from an uncle, grandparent, stepmother or -father, neighbours or a priest, who earns money from exorcisms. The children may see some of the people who drove them out, which can of course create insecurity, but our children are made of sterner stuff. We have found on many occasions that they have walked into their village with a spring in their step, confidence and a fierce look in their eye.  <br><br>It's fantastic to see, and their families are delighted to see their children again.  <br><br><br>INCREDIBLE TRANSFORMATION<br><br>The objective of home visits is therefore to change the perception of the villages of superstition by showing them the incredible transformation these children have been through - from being cast out, alone, accused of being witches, almost tortured to death, to being healthy, strong, good in school with self-confidence and dreams for their future. We can convince the entire village this way that the children are not witches, and that their accusers have been indoctrinated by either the local priest or other villagers. The children are slowly but surely accepted by the local population when they see their incredible transformation. The seeds are sown for acceptance and reintegration into the local community, and several of our children therefore hold their school holidays with their families.  <br><br>The work is long-term, and requires that the children make regular home visits. Their families also often visit them at Land of Hope. It's also important that they take responsibility for the dreadful past the children have suffered, and work with us to enlighten their villages about the rights of children.  <br><br>A family bond is very strong in the African society, and even though superstition can seem to break that bond, it is usually due to poverty and ignorance, which can only be fought by expanding their knowledge of the world, teaching them about superstition and the importance of education.",

      'NGO Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA NGO) unites representatives of artistic and expert communities working with contemporary art in Ukraine, systematically develops the sphere, and advocates the necessity to create a new type of museum institution in our country.<br><br>MOCA NGO history:<br>The organization was established in 2020 on the basis of the NGO Dzygamedialab (2015), which has been developing the Open Archive of Ukrainian Media Art and related projects for five years. The discussion on the need for museification of contemporary art in Ukraine has continued in the professional environment since the mid-1990s. In 2019 it was supported by the efforts of Minister of Culture (Volodymyr Borodyansky, 2019-2020), and then the museum issue went beyond purely professional discussion. In March 2020, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy selected the scientific research by the group, which has been working at the National Art Museum of Ukraine since 2017, to implement the professional museum institution of contemporary art. Two of the nine participants in that working group joined the group of Advisors of the MOCA NGO, and four joined the self-governing MOCA Expert Councils initiated by the MOCA NGO.<br><br>Co-founders of MOCA NGO put their minds and efforts into the art system-developing projects. <br><br>Here is a link to the co-founders interview on the museum creation issues subject (July 2021): https://artmargins.com/on-the-concept-of-the-museum-of-contemporary-art-in-ukraine-svitlana-biedarieva-in-conversation-with-olya-balashova-and-yuliia-hnat/<br><br><br>Since 2021, together with several dozen colleagues, involved in one way or another, we have been working on primary issues that will make contemporary art in Ukraine more accessible for the professional community and broader audiences, in particular, through advanced museum activities. We strive to create conditions for productive work in the field of contemporary art.<br><br>Before 24th February 2022, there were three directions in MOCA NGO program activities: <br>1. Institutional (the projects that facilitate the structural development of the art field). <br>2. Science + Education + Communications. <br>3. Interaction with the authorities (the projects that provide guidance from the professional community and support to the state institutions).<br><br>We believe that an advanced system of contemporary art, as we consider it and work on it, delivers results in the following areas: <br>"Contact with the Contemporary" <br>"Thinking" <br>"Understanding yourself" ("Identity") <br>"Accumulation of values," primarily - the symbolic values of contemporary artworks. It affects the reputation, social, and economic value projections at the both levels of individuals and society as a whole.<br>This is our choice that shapes our activities and our relationships with our teammates, colleagues and partners. We would describe our activities as liquid, shared, digital, based on relations/ integrations/ networks, glocal, sustainable on point.<br><br><br>Since 24th February 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, MOCA NGO has been focusing on the projects that are particularly relevant during the war days and afterwards and established the Ukrainian Emergency Art Fund in partnership with The Naked Room, ZABORONA and Mystetskyi Arsenal.<br><br>MOCA NGO actual priorities:<br><br>Short term:<br>+community: support and development of the art community in Ukraine;<br>+content: working with art practices results.<br><br>Long term:<br>country transformations caused by the development of advanced art system (new type of professional museum as a core element).<br><br>------<br><br>The Ukrainian Emergency Art Fund (UEAF) raises funds to distribute to independent artists, curators, art managers, researchers, culture workers and non-governmental cultural initiatives in need. <br><br>As you can see on the UEAF website (https://ueaf.moca.org.ua) :<br><br>UEAF mission: Today, the world needs free, strong and alive voices of Ukrainian cultural actors more than ever. Our task is to ensure the continuity and development of the Ukrainian cultural process during the war.<br><br>UEAF priorities:<br>1. Survival/emergency needs:<br>support for cultural workers who have remained in Ukraine and urgently need support to ensure a basic standard of living and security.<br>2. Development needs:<br>to ensure the visibility of Ukrainian culture in Ukraine and abroad, we support cultural workers and artists in Ukraine and those who relocated abroad after the start of a full-scale Russian war against Ukraine. We strive to support:<br>+ individual creative activity of artists and cultural workers;<br>+ continuity of research of curators, theoreticians, researchers and other cultural workers;<br>+ support packages for NGOs and cultural initiatives to support and enhance their programs and activities.<br><br>UEAF team do:<br>+ facilitate support and administer donations offered by international artistic and charity organisations, as well as from private donors;<br>+ provide support for cultural actors from different sectors( independent artists, curators, arts managers, researchers, writers etc) and cultural NGOs in Ukraine;<br>+ provide the opportunity to live and work for cultural workers, who decided to stay in Ukraine in order to preserve the cultural heritage of their area (museums, private collections, architectural monuments), etc.<br>+ globally promote contemporary Ukrainian culture as a powerful instrument for protection of the values of democracy and freedom in the world.',

      "Wildtracks is a well established conservation organization working towards the sustainable future of the natural resources of Belize, through conservation of ecosystems and species, building engagement and strengthening capacity towards effective environmental stewardship at all levels.<br><br>The organization was established in 1990, and registered as a Belize non-profit organization in 1996. In collaboration with its partners, Wildtracks has made critical contributions towards conservation in Belize, and has demonstrated high cost effectiveness, effective project and strategy implementation, with built-in evaluation, and with a demonstrable, consistent success record.<br><br>Wildtracks is recognised at national level for its conservation successes, has a highly motivated team, and an international following of dedicated supporters. The organization is very focused - its programs and program strategies are designed to support national and global goals and address critical gaps, and fall into four areas:<br><br>1. Biodiversity Conservation (Landscapes / Seascapes; Protected Areas; Endangered Species)<br>2. Sustainable Development (Coastal Communities; Climate Change; Sustainable Fisheries)<br>3. Outreach (In-situ and Ex-situ education, outreach and engagement at all levels)<br>4. Support (Volunteer Programme; Capacity Building; Conservation Consultancy Services; Financial Sustainability; Administration)<br><br>Biodiversity Conservation<br><br>Landscapes  / Seascapes:  Wildtracks has partnered with other stakeholders towards the successful declaration of the North East Biological Corridor in Belize, linking key protected areas within the tropical forest landscape, and protecting wide ranging species such as jaguar and tapir.<br>In the marine environment, Wildtracks has been providing technical support for the strengthening  of river to reef communication and collaboration between five protected areas in the northern Belize seascape.<br><br>Endangered Species Conservation: Wildtracks has partnered with Government and non-Government stakeholders to address wildlife trafficking in Belize, strengthening recognition of wildlife crime for improved multi-agency enforcement. It also hosts two of Belize's four wildlife rehabilitation centres - for endangered Antillean manatees and two species of primates - endangered Yucatan black howler monkeys and critically endangered Central American spider monkeys, focusing on effective wildlife rehabilitation and release as part of integrated species conservation strategies. Both have the highest success rates in the region, with strategic species reintroductions to strengthen species viability.<br><br>Sustainable Development: Wildtracks works with its local partners, the Sarteneja Alliance for Conservation and Development, providing technical support for the community based organization towards effective management of Corozal Bay Wildlife Sanctuary, one of Belize's largest marine protected areas, and an important site for manatees. The organization has worked with both the co-managers and local fishermen towards the development of a rights based fishery, protecting traditional fishing practices and building stewardship of the fish resources. It has also worked with the Sarteneja community to develop and implement a community tourism development plan that has provided a roadmap for tourism development in the community, based on a common vision. As part of this, Wildtracks has provided tour guide training for more than 30 local fishermen, allowing them to shift from fishing to tourism. It has also been working to build climate change resilience in marine protected areas and vulnerable coastal communities.<br><br>Outreach: The Outreach Programme focuses on effective partnerships to build capacity at national and local levels for improved environmental stewardship. Wildtracks engages students from schools around Belize, particularly in species conservation, building awareness of ecosystem services and climate change resilience. In the coming  two years, Wildtracks will be investing in infrastructure and equipment to better support its education and outreach activities, to engage youths as conservation leaders in their communities.<br><br>Wildtracks achieves its outputs through its team of dedicated volunteers, who take on the daily maintenance of the endangered species in rehabilitation, and through the skill set of its directors for effective conservation planning and facilitation, bringing people together from all levels of society for concrete conservation successes. Much of the work is done on a volunteer basis, but the operating costs have been creeping higher, and there is now a critical need to diversify the income base. Income is currently through volunteer contributions to operating costs, grants, and through consultancy services in conservation planning for initiatives that meet the Wildtracks Mission, as a way of providing technical assistance and facilitation to conservation efforts on a local and national level whilst also<br>providing a financial sustainability mechanism for support of Wildtracks activities",

So far the volunteers have taken part 65 379 times in 1400 volunteering initiatives (called missions) in 175 towns across Bulgaria.<br><br>The platform is the main, and often sole, source for Bulgarian nonprofit organizations and active citizens to recruit volunteers. <br><br>To achieve our mission to develop Bulgaria's volunteering culture, we run several further projects. <br><br>ANNUAL AWARDS<br>We established the annual volunteering awards THE HEROES, which reward outstanding volunteers, organisers, responsible companies and media (after open nominations), and promote and stimulate volunteering as a whole. In 2017 a jury selected 23 of the 226 nominees and these were announced at an official ceremony that was widely covered in media, was attended by 250+ guests and was streamed 26 000 times.<br><br>YOUTH VOLUNTEERING<br>We are growing a network of school and university volunteer clubs across the country.

This project aims to tackle the pervasive societal isolation in this age group in Bulgaria. <br><br>CAPACITY BUILDING<br>Through workshops and systematised good practices we are actively building the capacity of Bulgarian nongovernmental organisations for working with volunteers. In 2015-2016 we collected and systematised the experience of 250 Bulgarian NGOs working with volunteers. We are sharing this know-how in a wiki platform, a 100-page handbook and a series of workshops. Over 1000 NGOs have received the handbook, about 100 have so far participated in our highly-rated workshops. We also fundraise and distribute monthly small grants enabling volunteer involvement in causes.",

He had been impressed with the work of the Religious Sisters of Charity in Cork, especially during the Famine, and bequeathed to them whatever remained of his estate on condition that they provide a hospital for the people of Cork.<br><br>Marymount University Hospital & Hospice is a healthcare facility which provides two distinct services. The elderly care facility provides respite care, intermediate palliative care and continuing care for older people. Marymount Hospice provides care to patients with progressive illness, both cancer and non-cancer, at a time when pain or other symptom issues need addressing. Patients on active treatment may benefit from a short term admission for symptom control and rehabilitation. Support is offered to families facing loss or who are bereaved. Marymount is the designated Specialist Care Centre for the Cork/Kerry region serving a population of approximately 600,000.<br><br>The facility was founded in 1870 and in September 2011 moved from its long-time city centre location, no longer fit for purpose, to a new purpose built state of the art facility at Curraheen on the edge of Cork city. The new facility provides 44 specialist palliative care beds an extensive ambulatory care/day care facility, accommodation for the community palliative care team, and full educational and library resources. There are 63 elderly care beds and a day care facility on campus.<br><br>There is a long and proud tradition of providing high quality clinical, psycho-social and spiritual care to patients and their families. There is an active and developing interdisciplinary teaching and research programme with strong University links. There are recognised training programmes for doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers and chaplains in the principles and practice of palliative care and all are approved by recognised governing bodies such as The Medical Council, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and An Bord Altranais. The service is designed to help people live as actively as possible in the face of advancing illness. The patient and their family are at all times at the centre of our philosophy of care.<br><br>The cost of providing this service is met by a combination of state funding and, increasingly, by donated funds.<br><br>"Our mission statement is as follows:<br><br>in providing excellent care, we cherish the uniqueness and dignity of each person, showing compassion and respect.  We strive for quality and integrity in all we do.',

      "Afghanaid is a British humanitarian and development organisation established in 1983. For close to 40 years, we have worked in Afghanistan with millions of deprived, excluded and vulnerable families in some of the poorest and most remote communities. <br> <br>Our mission is to provide rural Afghans with the training and tools they need to help themselves, their families and their communities. We support basic service provision, improve livelihoods, empower women, help communities protect against natural disasters, and respond to humanitarian crises. Afghanaid currently operates in eight provinces, and through our wide range of development and humanitarian programming we reached approximately 1.64 million Afghans in 2019.<br> <br>Afghanaid employs 395 full time staff, with 389 of those based in Afghanistan, the overwhelming majority of whom are Afghans. We work in Badakhshan, Daykundi, Ghor, Herat, Logar, Nangarhar, Samangan and Takhar provinces. Afghanaid primarily works in three programmatic areas: access to basic services; improved livelihoods; disaster risk reduction and emergency assistance.<br> <br>Our 'Access to Basic Services' pillar supports communities to improve their basic service provision and community infrastructure, helping them mobilise, design, and implement small-scale community development projects. Afghanaid has been a facilitating partner for both the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) and Citizen's Charter National Priority Programme (CCNPP) since 2003.<br> <br>Our 'Improved Livelihoods' pillar supports Afghan men and women, in rural and urban communities, to strengthen their livelihoods, increase their incomes, and improve their access to new markets and value chains. Therefore, enabling households to lift themselves out of poverty. We also promote sustainable livelihoods, ensuring communities protect and manage their natural resources such as water and rangelands.<br> <br>Our 'Disaster Risk Reduction and Emergency Assistance' pillar supports communities to plan for, respond to, and mitigate the impact of natural disasters. When disasters do occur, including displacement or conflict, we provide emergency humanitarian assistance and help communities to rebuild, restore productive land and community infrastructure, and recover their livelihoods.<br> <br>All of our programming is underpinned by three key principles, which we believe are essential to sustainable development in Afghanistan: conflict mitigation and peacebuilding; gender and inclusion; and good governance. We believe in a peaceful and thriving Afghanistan. It is crucial that, after decades of war, Afghans have a voice in their peaceful development, making them active participants in shaping the future of their country. We work with both women and men to challenge traditional gender norms and improve gender equality. Our projects are disability inclusive and support marginalised groups. Finally, we continuously work to strengthen the relationship between citizens and local authorities, and promote meaningful engagement with political processes.<br> <br>Afghanaid is also the lead agency of the Afghanistan Resilience Consortium (ARC), which was established in 2014 as a partnership between Afghanaid, ActionAid, Concern Worldwide, and Save the Children. The ARC integrates natural resource management, disaster risk reduction, and livelihood strengthening with a community-led approach to create lasting resilience for Afghanistan's communities and ecosystems. The ARC's holistic programming recognizes that conflict and environmental degradation can exacerbate the impacts of natural hazards, and strives to support communities and improve ecosystem management in order to reduce the risk of disasters and build adaptive capacity to climate change.",

This blindspot in conservation is a challenge because of the total systemic complexity in which the lion exists. Our foundation seeks to address this issue from all angles through:<br>1. Buying up large tracts of land to preserve in perpetuity for lions and thus other wildlife species<br>2. Educate and empower rural communities living on the fringes of wildlife habitats so as to show meaningful benefit to conserving the wildlife surrounding them. Through providing opportunities for nature sensitization (especially for students) and respond to the immediate needs of these communities, we hope to help break the destructive habits of poaching and the bush meat trade.<br>3. Collaborate with a wide range of like minded individuals - we welcome scientists, artists, students, house moms, influencers, anyone with a passion for conserving the lion and other species, to come together to creatively pool our talent and resources to find innovative ways to address issues such as captive lion breeding, canned hunting and cub petting and help bring an end to these barbaric practices. historically we have worked with closely with scientists, especially those of the University of Pretoria's Wildlife Management Programme in their Carnivore studies to help provide more data on protecting big cats and improving their care when in captive situations or undergoing translocation.<br>4. Protect and maintain the Kevin Richardson wildlife sanctuary which is home to 40 predators rescued from the captive breeding and canned hunting industry.

We believe that veterinary care should be affordable and accessible. We believe that no animal should be surrendered to a shelter to be euthanized because their owner can't afford needed veterinary care. The Community Animal Medicine Project -- CAMP (formerly called Spay Neuter Project of Los Angeles, SNP LA) is Southern California’s largest non-profit veterinary organization providing indispensable pet care services throughout Los Angeles’ most underserved communities.We operate four low cost, high volume spay/neuter and community animal medicine clinics in South Los Angeles, San Pedro and Mission Hills and run mobile clinics that travel throughout Los Angeles County bringing care directly to the communities that need it. We also operate CAMP’s Veterinary Training Project, training veterinary professionals in the desperately needed skills of high volume, high quality spay/neuter surgical skills and techniques. This scholarship supported program was established to provide solutions to the overburdened shelter system and to meet the veterinary shortage head on. Since we opened our doors in 2007, the CAMP veterinarian staff have performed over 300,000 spay/neuter surgeries - preventing the birth of millions of puppies and kittens into homelessness. Our community animal medicine veterinary programs reach over 80,000 pets annually providing affordable spay/neuter, vaccine and wellness care services to historically excluded communities in Los Angeles. CAMP is about community!",

Our country is a declared state since 2013 and declared of public utility. We are a present in 134 countries where we serve more than 400 000 children and their families. We are also members of UNESCO and advised by the ONU Economic and Social Council. <br> <br>Our reason for being. <br> <br>There are a number of social, economic, cultural, political and external factors in Latin America and the Caribbean that, at times associated with unfavorable socio-economic situations, may put children at risk of losing care for their families or significant adults. The complex interaction between these factors, such as natural disasters, armed conflict, interfamily and gender violence, problematic drug use, commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking, migration, among others; Expose children and their families to a situation of greater vulnerability, requiring responses to guarantee the exercise of their rights. <br> <br>In this sense, in the Asociacion Aldeas Infantiles SOS Costa Rica we work for the children right of family living. We develop actions to prevent the loss of family care, provide care alternatives for children who were separated from their families and develop advocacy actions, seeking to create the necessary conditions for children to fully exercise their rights. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE <br>                                                                   <br> <br> <br> <br>   2 <br> <br>What do we do? <br> <br>We work for the children right of family living. The organization's efforts are aimed at preventing the loss of children's family care, and when it is lost, we provide them with alternatives of care, always working to bring the children back to their families and communities whenever possible or other possibilities of family living. <br> <br>How do we do it? <br> <br>1. To prevent the loss of family care we carry out support actions for family and community strengthening through:  Pedagogical proposals of daily care for children  Capacity building of children and their families  Coordination of local networks work. <br> <br>2. For those children who lost family care we provide care alternatives based on family environments, seeking their integral development and considering their particular situation and the needs of each locality. <br> <br>Family life care: usually under the SOS family model, in the village houses, where we promote that children have a stable affective referent for as long as it require, promoting if possible the reinstatement to their family of origin. <br> <br>3. We carry out awareness actions in order to ensure quality standards in the care of all children. We advocate the states to strengthen and improve social protection systems, carrying out campaigns and programs, to ensure that all children, adolescents and young people have a full exercise of their rights, especially a family living.",

      'The Stonewall Group is the largest organization fighting for the rights of LGBT+ people in the Wielkopolska region. The Group has been active since 2015 in the following areas: advocacy, education, help/intervention, culture, and healthcare. The Group comprises 41 members and around 50 volunteers cooperate with us. The board comprises five members. Each of them is responsible for a few areas of activity.<br><br>Our flagship activity is the Poznan Pride Week festival (we organized a few hundred events in the course of five editions of the festival), which culminated in the Equality March (13,000 people participated in 2019). We help LGBT+ people and their families. For four years now, we have been co-operating with six therapists holding psychological consultations which have been provided for around 200 individuals now. We run five support groups for: youth, transgender people, families of LGBT+ people, bisexual people, and LGBT+ people from Ukraine. We provide legal help for LGBT+ people, who are often victims of hate crimes (the legal help is also partially financed by municipal grants); since 2016 we have provided a few hundred hours of support in total, which also consisted in representing a client. We organize many cultural activities: produce concerts, theatre plays, and organize meetings with authors. We are also active in the area of healthcare - thanks to the grant from the city of Poznan, we are organizing a training project for therapists about so-called ChemSex. In 2019, we were commissioned by Panstwowy Zakad Higieny (State Institute of Hygiene) to conduct research about ChemSex. We provide free testing for HIV, syphilis, and HCV. We train companies about antidiscrimination (e.g., Allegro, Franklin Templeton). In 2019, we organized the first edition of Letnia Akademia Rownosci (Summer Equality Academy) - we visited seven cities in Poland, combating harmful stereotypes about LGBT+ people (funded by Sprite).<br><br>We conduct business activity - we manage the bar Lokum Stonewall bar which has become not only a meeting place for the Poznan LGBT+ community, but also the main stage of Polish queer culture for such events like weekly drag queen performances. The bar also boosts our visibility - it is located on the main pedestrian street in the center of Poznan (facebook.com/LokumStonewall). What is more, as a part of our business activities, we run an online shop (outandproud.pl) and organize trainings for companies.',

      "WAG-Rwanda's mission is to improve the health and welfare of domestic animals, specifically dogs, in Rwanda. WAG began in 2014 as a grassroots initiative to help stray dogs in Rwanda find homes. Using foster care homes and a recently established small shelter space, WAG dogs receive food, veterinary care, love and socialization until they are adopted. At the core of our project's mission is that every dog, regardless of age, breed or sex receives equal investment of resources and care. In addition to rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming street dogs, WAG provides emergency assistance to dogs in crisis (severe injuries, rescue from abusive situations etc). We also play a role in advocating for animal welfare, support spay and neuters, vaccinate against rabies and serve as a valuable resource to dog owners. WAG is run by volunteers, and employs one full-time and one part-time shelter staff members to care for our dogs. <br> <br>Alongside our core activities of rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming street dogs, we are involved in conducting research and working with stakeholders in rabies elimination and humane reduction of street dog population. We are currently running a research project mapping the dog population and demographics in one district in Kigali, funded by the Royal Society of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. This is with the aim of producing the first research on dog demographics in Rwanda and creating a tool for dog enumeration across Rwanda. WAG is also represented on Rwanda's National Rabies Elimination Technical Working Group, with the Government of Rwanda and World Health Organisation. Despite being a relatively small project, we are currently the only organisation exclusively working with dogs in the country. Our work is based in Rwanda's capital city, Kigali.<br><br>Three recent notable achievements include: <br><br>Opening a pilot dog shelter: After acquiring official NGO status and government support of the project, WAG opened a pilot dog shelter in December 2020. This shelter is the first of its kind in the country. This space has allowed us to expand our rescue efforts by providing a temporary landing spot to dogs prior to placement in foster homes, some right to adoption. It can also host up to 20 dogs who may need additional support.  The dogs housed at the shelter have been thriving and we have plans to replicate this project on a larger scale within the next 5 years. <br><br>Rehoming: In the last 3 years WAG has rehomed 176 rescue dogs with loving, permanent families.  These dogs were stray or abandoned with varying degrees of health or behavioural challenges prior to rescue. They have all been spayed / neutered and vaccinated. Of note, these stats were impacted by COVID 19, with no adoptions able to take place between March - June of 2020 and again in December - February 2021 due to public health guidelines. <br><br>Promotion of humane dog population control and responsible dog ownership to key stakeholders: WAG presented at the first Annual Conference of Veterinary Doctors in Rwanda, run by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources and the Rwanda Council of Veterinary Doctors, on the topic of the Rescue, Rehabilitate and Rehome model to humanely reduce dog populations in Rwanda. This has since led to WAG being part of the Rwanda National Rabies Elimination Technical Working Group, where WAG advocates for sustainable and humane dog population control and the role of responsible dog ownership in policy to improve dog welfare, human-dog relationships and reduce human-dog conflict. WAG is in early-stage talks with the Government of Rwanda stakeholders and World Health Organisation in ways forward to support the government in rabies elimination and stray dog population management by expanding our model both in and outside Kigali.<br><br>Now we are successfully operating our pilot shelter, and have support from the Government of Rwanda, we are seeking to expand our fundraising efforts to employ a part-time staff member to oversee adoptions and community engagement which will increase our capacity and ability to help more people and dogs. We are looking for more sustainable ways to guaranteed funding to allow us to do this, as well as expand our work into conducting vaccination and sterilisation projects in the community, which has the strong support from the local government but requires funding.",

      "The HERD (Hoedspruit Elephant Rehabilitation and Development) TRUST was established in 2021 following a 24-year journey in caring for elephants that have been displaced or orphaned due to human-elephant conflict.<br><br>With the growing numbers of orphans and displaced elephant calves in recent years, due to rampant poaching of elephant mothers as well as human-elephant conflict, Adine Roode, HERD Founder, took the step to build an elephant orphanage in South Africa, to provide an adoptive family structure for calves in need.<br>The HERD Orphanage was built in 2019 in response to a growing number of young orphaned elephant calves that need a place of rehabilitation and more importantly, an existing herd that will accept them unconditionally.<br><br>The Jabulani Herd is now a family of 16 elephants, of which 11 are orphans and five that were born to the herd over 10 years ago. In 2004 the lodge, Jabulani, was built to sustain the herd, with proceeds from tourism assisting with the care and management of the rescued herd.<br>In 2021 a decision was made to move the Jabulani herd and the HERD Homestead operations (formally known as the Jabulani stables) together with the HERD Orphanage, under the umbrella of the HERD Trust which is a registered PBO Number 930072153. This allows for public funding to ensure the well-being of all the elephants.<br><br>The HERD Trust also commits to being active within our local communities through education and awareness, as well as our online communities, bringing a global audience together to educate a larger audience about the elephant species and the essential conservation efforts undertaken by various organisations around the world.<br><br>It is our mission through HERD (Hoedspruit Elephant Rehabilitation and Development), South Africa's first and only dedicated elephant orphanage, to rehabilitate orphaned elephants from the traumatic or near-fatal challenges that have caused them to be abandoned. It is our mission to give them a second chance of life with a herd, as the social and complex nature of the species requires that they live within a herd for their own wellbeing. <br><br>Our objectives are to provide a safe rehabilitation alternative for elephant orphans that prioritises the long-term well-being of the elephants. To establish a strategy and long-term plan for elephant rehabilitation through rewilding that includes ways to mitigate the long-term chronic stress of releasing elephants directly into the wild when, as orphans, they don't have a proper social structure. The focus is on building the orphans' ability to deal with a wild system independently, in such a way that allows them to develop that capacity at a reasonable pace, and within a stable and nurturing system. Thus, the rewilding of captive elephants that takes elephant biology and local context into account. <br><br>Our principals underpinning the approach:<br>a. Emphasis and focus on the rehabilitation and rewilding as both short and long-term objectives, that considers the social and sentient nature of elephants, their longevity, and the need for their learning and social development to take place in a protective, nurturing, and safe context and environment. <br>b. Take into account the importance of social learning, bonding, and role building for orphans by creating a novel system of responsibly wilding or reintegrating elephants.<br>c. It is unethical to simply release orphans into the wild without the opportunity for them to develop a robust social decision-making and behavioural system, within a structured support system, that people can, and have the obligation to, provide.<br>d. Creating sustainable wellbeing for orphan elephants, responsible and transparent mechanisms to support direct costs attached to handraising and caring of elephants, and the herd into which they will be introduced, and which is engaged with broader society.<br>e. Run an ethical, accredited, and credible operation, with a fully constituted ethics committee, and with an advisory committee with the appropriate expertise. <br>f. Recognize the existence value of elephants for broader society, and to take on the custodianship role (all animals are under the custodianship of all people), on behalf of broader society, so that people know that animals are being protected and supported in an ethical way that gives people a sense of humaneness and humanity - this is one of our global values. <br>g. Based on a long-term strategy for rewilding of orphan elephants that enhances wellbeing, and takes into consideration their longevity, and the long-term responsibility that we collectively have as a society to caring for orphaned elephants through their entire lifetime. <br>h. Enhance and expand the contribution of elephants to human social and economic development, and human livelihoods and wellbeing, especially in the local region. <br>i. Not causing unnecessary suffering or harm; <br>j. There is no breeding of captive elephants. <br>k. New orphans increase the wellbeing of the Jabulani elephant herd by improving the social structure of the herd, and providing the conditions for natural social interactions and processes. <br>l. Introduction of calves can play a positive role in the emotional wellbeing and behaviour of the Jabulani herd, and the herd provides the most humane mechanism to reintegrate orphans into elephant society that is available.<br>m. There is no promoting the removal of any babies from the wild. <br>n. It is not the first choice to have captive elephants, and we understand the risks posed by the complex social nature of elephants.<br>o. There are clear specific criteria for taking orphans for rehabilitation, such as when orphans are the direct consequence of human interference and human created problems, such as poaching. <br>p. Elephants are only accepted as a results of confiscation, donation, or rescue and approved by, official government agencies. All orphans accepted are properly permitted. <br>q. We do not promote, base, or drive the operation on creating a market for orphans. Orphans are accepted in the interests of the orphans, as such, and not to have any resale value. <br>r. The Jabulani herd was rescued from a perilous situation, and are being provided with a protected and comfortable environment, that meets their biological and social requirements within the limitations of a previously tamed herd. <br>s. The commitment to the Jabulani herd is to ensure their wellbeing for their natural lives.",

    description:
      "The Paardeberg Sustainability Initiative (later known as PSI) was conceived in 2001, in recognition of threats to the biodiversity and natural resources of the Paardeberg, a privately-owned mountain in the Western Cape, South Africa. A primary threat is economic pressure common to many South African  farmers and landowners. Additional and aggravating threats are global climate shifts, poverty, limited statehood, compromised capacity, education and implementation/enforcement of legislation. These challenges must be addressed to fulfill world guidelines (Agenda 21, SDG's, etc) for sustainable development.<br><br>PSI is now  a  VAT- registered   Non Profit company [NPC] and Public Benefit Organisation  with Section 18A tax exempt status. It is aligned with several partners which share its vision, and in this sense can be described as collaborative facilitator. Through fundraising for various integrated  projects, the PSI seeks to promote sustainability in the Paardeberg locally and also in broader Southern African contexts. The PSI  encourages  profitable businesses and corporates to contribute generously  and tax-efficiently to a central fund that is managed by the Board of Directors of the PSI. These funds are either 'ring- fenced' for specific projects, or allocated to projects requiring support, through a process that seeks to fulfill both the agenda of the donor and the mandate of the PSI.<br><br>The PSI houses both enterprises (SMME's) and projects. Projects depend on the PSI for funding, while the enterprises represent potential sources of funds/assets for the PSI. The PSI acts as an umbrella offering core functions of administration, marketing, HR management, accounting, etc to all projects and SMME's, based on an economy of scale. It is thus an ideal incubator to develop new businesses while minimizing risk. <br><br>The vision of the PSI is<br> to create a successful model of sustainable development,<br> promoted by profitable enterprises and non-profitable projects,<br> co-operating in partnerships that oversee responsible management of natural resources and biodiversity ,<br> within an economic framework that obviates the plague of poverty and social decay<br> while upholding the law and supporting good governance.<br><br><br>The PSI has housed several projects, including the Paardeberg Fire Project, Paardeberg Environmental Awareness and Response(ongoing), Paardeberg Alternative Energy Solutions(ongoing), Paardeberg Botanical Surveys, PSI NatReM Project and the Paardeberg Erosion Project. It has also acted as an incubator of SMME's engaged in these and other projects. All finances are conducted through a central bank account, but independently managed and audited for each project/business  separately,  as per the PSI MOI. The PSI does not prejudice the independence of enterprises or projects falling within its ambit. However, its role in protecting biodiversity and natural resources  influences the directives it generates. Participation of all interested and affected parties  is key to the application of these directives.",

      'Action10 is a Swedish non-profit, non-religious and non-political membership organisation operating on a voluntarily basis and with charity funding. The vision of Action10 is a world free from extreme poverty, where everyone has access to education, employment, healthcare and social security as well as safe water, food, sanitation and energy. Countries are run by good governance and have sustainable economy. To pursue its vision the mission of Action10 is to be an independent initiative with a broad and flexible mandate to work with stakeholders and partners on projects and programs that address international development. Action10 operates in a sustainable, effective and efficient manner, through its unique strategy SEEDS (Sustainable Effective Efficient Development Strategy)                                                                                                                                                  The over-arching value platform of Action10 is that it is the Government at the macro level and the Civil Society Organsisations and the individual extreme poor at the micro level, who are the experts on the actions to be taken, and who have the capacity and knowledge to drive the development processes forward. But that the environment and the infrastructure where they operate hinder the process. The aim of the Action10 approach is therefore to offer support to Governments and to the extreme poor addressing the infrastructural and financial challenges to eradicate extreme poverty. It is the dreams of the extreme poor which is the core of the Action10 approach. Those dreams constitute the vision of each program. The mission is what needs to be done to address these dreams. After having identified the dreams the Action10 approach compiles the challenges that the extreme poor face. Those challenges describe the reasons for why they cannot reach their dreams. We call the compilation of challenges Outcome challenges. Linked to each Outcome challenge is a Progress marker. The purpose of the Progress markers is to enable evaluation planning of the program activities. Thus the Progress markers are well defined indicators which can be easily monitored and assessed. The Outcome Challenges also define the Strategy Map. The Strategy Map is a set of concrete activities that must be addressed to reach the dreams. The concept of Outcome Challenges, Progress Markers and Strategy Map were initially invented by Earl, Carden et al. in 2001 and are components of the Outcome Mapping tool. After the Strategy Map has been defined, a sustainable economy scheme is developed. The Programs are either a social enterprises or components of the national development program. A social enterprise shall generate revenue which covers all program costs, as well as pays company tax in the country of operation. If no revenue can be expected short term, which can be the case with for example basic education or social security programs, then the program is funded as a component of the national authorities development program. A crucial component is also that all partners have strong enough institutional capacity to manage the programs. Each partner are encouraged to annually assess and their own institutional capacity. Action10 is offering tools for the assessment as well as training and coaching on finance administration and accounting. All of the above aspects are, in the Action10 approach, subjected to real-time evaluation planning (EP). Action10 has developed a tool for the EP wich contains five steps. The first measures to what extent the progress markers have been achieved, the second the operational aspects, the third the strategy, the fourth the sustainable economy and the fifth the institutional capacity. The United Nations states that in 2013 1.2 billion people still live in extreme poverty. Extreme poor have been defined by the UN as those people earning an income of less than $ 1.25 per day. UN states that the Millennium Development Goals which were identified and agreed on in year 2000 by 197 heads of states and which were to be achieved in 2015, are far from being reached. The Action10 approach benefits from the lessons learnt from previous international aid programs. Through an analysis of previous aid programs, Ten Actions were identified which, if addressed thoroughly in all development programs, are expected to reduce and eventually eradicate extreme poverty. All the Ten actions are thoroughly captured in all Action10 activities. Our Ten Actions are based on these 10 principles; 1. Needs driven program 2. Equal partnership 3. Real time evaluation planning  4. Strategic partnership 5. Institutional capacity 6. Sustainable economy 7. Quality values  8. Resilience 9. Knowledge sharing  10. Visibility',

Insan is independent from any government, political ideology, economic interest or religion, and does not support or oppose any government or political system.    We act to protect and promote the rights of the most marginalized individuals, families and children living in Lebanon- such as refugees, migrant workers, asylum seekers and non identities - without any discrimination. The different services and activities of Insan Association reach out to include individuals from different nationalities, cultures, religions and social status. Insan's beneficiaries come from different countries such as: Sudan, Iraq, India, Egypt, Jordan, Kurdish Syrians, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Pakistan, Ghana, Bangladesh, originally Lebanese but not registered (non-IDs) and others, all living in Lebanon in very poor and difficult conditions and their children are deprived of most of their basic human rights.    Insan pays close attention to children and offers schooling and other kinds of support to underprivileged children, who are neglected by society and suffer from discrimination, extreme poverty or the lack of legal papers.   The Insan School accepts migrant children who are otherwise not able to enrol into regular schools as a result of poverty, discrimination, or the lack of appropriate documentation.  With its holistic approach Insan does not only provides education but on a case by case basis, offers psychological and social support to the children as well as their parents and families. The organization believes that children have a right to be free from abuses, exploitation and neglect. Children, who benefit from Insan's services, face discrimination, insecurity and poverty - their lives can be unstable and chaotic. The organization is therefore committed to creating a secure environment for them. Insan aims to empower these communities to help themselves and take control of their lives. Insan has a rights-based approach. It believes in the principles of human rights and that respect for human rights can create lasting changes in people's lives and make them reach their full potential by diminishing the causes of poverty and injustice.  All of Insan's programmes aim towards the integration of its beneficiaries into the Lebanese society in every possible way.",

      'The motto of Sailabilty Vlaanderen vzw (Sailability) is "Iedereen moet kunnen zeilen"(Everybody should be able to sail)<br>INTRODUCTION<br>In simple terms the objectives of Sailability are to promote the benefits of sailing to people with mental and physical handicaps.  This extends to everyone regardless of age, class, gender, ethnicity and physical status including the disadvantaged and those who cannot contribute financially.  These latter we will support and will not allow to be excluded on financial grounds. We also welcome able bodied members (usually family members) to encourage and reinforce the integration of disabled people into mainstream activities and society.<br>LOCATIONS<br>We intend to ensure this activity is available in at least one location in each of the five Provinces of Flanders by 2020 and that there are at least 100 active disabled sailors across the Region.  Sailability is located at Mol in Antwerp.  Disabled sailing in three other locations (Brugges - West Flanders, Vilvoorde - Flemish Brabant, and Gent - East Flanders) will operate in co-operation with regular sailing clubs based at those locations.<br>ROLE OF SAILABILITY IN NEW LOCATIONS<br>Sailability reviews the suitability of the locations and advises on adaptions that might be necessary to ensure accessibility and safety.  It will also loan boats and equipment (lifts/trailers) as required.  In addition experienced members will train and assist the host clubs. <br>FLEET<br>Our fleet will be 10 boats by March 2016.  We expect to be sourcing at least one to two boats each year to support increases in our activities.  If resources permit, additional books will be acquired.  We will continue to identify and acquire boats that are adapted for disabled people being very stable and unsinkable.  <br>ACTIVITIES<br>To date our activities have focused on recreational sailing and to a much lesser degree on competition sailing.  Recreational: The recreational sailing will grow mainly at the new locations we have identified and others we are looking into. <br>Competition: More effort will be put into participating in national and international competitions.  We will also be expanding National contests based on our work running the Flanders\' Sailability Cup contests in 2014 and 2015.  In these years we have welcomed participants from France, Switzerland, Australia and the Netherlands.  We have also taken part in competitions in France and the UK.<br>Rehabilitation: Further into our 2020 Strategic Vision Plan we will start with rehabilitation sailing activities together with Rehabilitation organisations and institutions.<br>Introduction to Sailing: We will continue to offer initiation/introductory sessions to other organisations which support or look after disabled people <br>TRAINING: <br>We will continue to train the sailing monitors and volunteers; we are also going to start a training program to encourage as many G-sailors as possible to have the confidence and ability to sail independently. <br>SHARING ASSETS: <br>We will continue to work with other organisations which encourage disabled people to engage in sports and activities; we will allow them to use our boats to maximize their utilization.<br>GOVERNANCE:<br>Sailability will continue to be managed by a Board of Directors which meets about once a month. It consists of a: - - Chairman, - Vice-Chairman, - Sailing Manager, - Secretary, - Treasurer, Communications and Public Relations Officer, - Competitions Officer.  Other members managing special projects attend board meetings as appropriate.<br>A Strategic plan was drawn up for the period 2015-2020.',

Individuals the world over are denied the right to freely own property, worship as they please or say what they want. We work with lawyers in these places to help change that and raise awareness of the rule of law gap.<br><br>Team members defend persons whose fundamental rights have been violated by authoritarian governments in local courts and international tribunals. We believe local accountability is an essential component of successful rule of law initiatives. For cases arising in foreign nations, we provide local counsel the legal and political support they need to resolve legal and political disputes, locally. We do this, in part, by first working with local counsel to exhaust domestic court options, rather than first advocating in international bodies or tribunals such as the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights, the United Nations Human Rights Council, among others',

      'In December 2020, French record companies decided to structure all their joint initiatives in favour of gender equality, equal opportunities, inclusion in general and ethics into an "All Access - Music" association. The founding objective is to accelerate the necessary changes within the music industry, whether in terms of equality or diversity.<br><br>The All Access Musique association is chaired by Natacha Krantz, Universal Music\'s Communications Director; it is administered by a board elected for two years and membership is open to any Company or organisation that shares its ambitions and wishes to contribute to its work.<br>The board is made up of 8 representatives of record labels - both independent and major - 4 women and 4 men.<br><br>The masterclasses of the All Access mentoring programme, which were introduced in January 2020, following the first Women in Music conference, were thus hosted by an organisation dedicated to <br>- the development of actions in the direction of parity <br>- the implementation of support measures for young people who are destined for the music industry.<br><br>On the subject of professional equality: <br><br>The first stone in the edifice that the producers wished to build to improve the place and visibility of women in their companies, the mentoring programme has been enriched, in addition to the monthly sessions based on the principle of role models, transmission and networking, with individual coaching sessions thanks to the partnership established with the Audiens group for 3 years.<br>Practical workshops, meetings with other groups of mentees and speeches by the association (MaMA 2021, Forum Generation Egalite, Assises de la Parite, etc.) have taken place over the past two years. <br>50 young women are now taking part in the third season of the All Access mentoring program; they come from all professions and from structures of all sizes.<br>The founding roadmap remains the guiding principle of this program: to move the lines in favour of women by offering employees at the beginning of their careers specific support to help them in their development thanks to an unprecedented experience:<br>- Regular exchanges with emblematic women professionals on all subjects,<br>- Share freely their daily concerns as well as their ambitions,<br>- Develop their network by building privileged relationships with their peers but also with experienced women,<br>- Have a space to listen and develop their self-confidence.<br><br>In 2021, thanks to the support of the Centre National de la Musique, the association was able to set up dedicated accounts on social networks, and to communicate regularly on the activities of All Access. The participants in the mentoring programme also benefited from a communication kit (personal photos taken by a professional photographer, training sessions to optimise LinkedIn profiles, etc.).<br><br>On the subject of equal opportunities: <br><br>The music producers united in the All Access Musique association are also driven by a clear ambition on the issues of equal opportunities, diversity and inclusion.<br>The first line of development chosen to provide a concrete response in this area is that of helping students in financial difficulty, but who are nonetheless passionate about the music business; this corresponds to the desire to help young talent to become professional and join the teams of labels and partners in the recorded music sector. <br>In this context and to help us identify needs with the help of specialists in the field, a partnership has been established with the Institut de l\'Engagement. <br>The awarding of scholarships to eligible students in the music industry master\'s programme is managed by the "Equal Opportunities Committee" of our association.<br>The first school associated with this programme is EMIC; other masters are being considered for the next integration sessions (the EDH group with ICART in particular).',

Cold, hungry, scared, tired, and dehydrated;many cats unfortunately suffer each year after being stuck in trees. That is why CANOPY CAT RESCUE rescues cats—anytime, day or night, in all kinds of weather. All cats deserve to be rescued and reunited with their loved ones. We work on a donations-only basis, because it’s our mission and passion to rescue any cat stuck in any tree regardless of their family's financial situation.

The regions and communities in Armenia are highly unequally developed in terms of access to art education and cultural life. For example, what creative/art classes the child will attend does not depend on the child's interest or talent, but on what is available in the community. In most communities, it is not even possible to attend any. In addition to access to art education, remote communities also face isolation from cultural events. The community members have limited opportunities, in some cases, they do not have any live interaction with culture and contact with the artists, which is an irreplaceable experience for the development of a person's aesthetic perceptions and creativity, formation of the attitude towards art, as well as a worldview. Besides limiting a person's ability to develop, cultural isolation affects the quality of community life, leading to the loss of unique cultural traditions of the community. Limited possibilities for the cultural life and lack of educational-cultural entertainment cause people to imagine and build their lives in communities with greater opportunities, therefore this closed chain of isolation is not being broken. Moreover, people leave their communities; as a result, they lose community identity and thus reduce the development potential and opportunity of the community. Every community has unlimited potential, and first of all, it is human potential. It is crucial to create space for discovering and realizing that potential. Culture allows us to best recognize the strengths of a person, to develop creativity, thus opening up an opportunity to find and implement innovative solutions to community problems. The community itself should have its own unique cultural policy, taking into account the context and priorities, the features and traditions of the community. On the other hand, any branch of art can be transformed into a social enterprise, ensuring the cultural, socio-economic self-sufficiency and development of the community. Kayt has successful experience in such programs in Movses, Khachik, Goris. The discovery and revitalization of the community's way of life, traditional rituals, and holidays will increase the community's touristic attractiveness, ensuring the community's recognition and socio-economic activation.",

    description:
      "Ashinaga is a Japanese foundation headquartered in Tokyo. We provide financial support and emotional care to young people around the world who have lost either one or both parents. With a history of more than 55 years, our support has enabled more than 110,000 orphaned students to gain access to higher education. <br><br> <br><br>From 2001, we expanded our activities internationally, with our first office abroad in Uganda. Since then, we have established new offices in Senegal, the US, Brazil, the UK, and France to support the Ashinaga Africa Initiative. <br><br> <br><br>The Ashinaga movement began after President and Founder, Yoshiomi Tamai's mother was hit by a car in 1963, putting her in a coma, and she passed away soon after. Tamai and a group of likeminded individuals went on to found the Association for Traffic Accident Orphans in 1967. Through public advocacy, regular media coverage and the development of a street fundraising system, the association was able to set in motion significant improvements in national traffic regulations, as well as support for students bereaved by car accidents across Japan.  <br><br> <br><br>Over time, the Ashinaga movement extended its financial and emotional support to students who had lost their parents by other causes, including illness, natural disaster, and suicide. The Ashinaga-san system, which involved anonymous donations began in 1979. This was inspired by the Japanese translation of the 1912 Jean Webster novel Daddy-Long-Legs. In 1993, Ashinaga was expanded to include offering residential facilities to enable financially disadvantaged students to attend universities in the more expensive metropolitan areas. Around this time Ashinaga also expanded its summer programs, or tsudoi, at which Ashinaga students could share their experiences amongst peers who had also lost parents. <br><br> <br><br>The 1995 Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake struck the Kobe area with a magnitude of 6.9, taking the lives of over 6,400 people and leaving approximately 650 children without parents. Aided by financial support from both Japan and abroad, Ashinaga established its first ever Rainbow House, a care facility for children to alleviate the resultant trauma. <br><br> <br><br>March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck the northeastern coast of Japan, causing a major tsunami, vast damage to the Tohoku region, and nearly 16,000 deaths. Thousands of children lost their parents as a result. Ashinaga responded immediately, establishing a regional office to aid those students who had lost parents in the catastrophe. With the assistance of donors from across the world, Ashinaga provided emergency grants of over $25,000 each to over 2,000 orphaned students, giving them immediate financial stability in the wake of their loss. Ashinaga also built Rainbow Houses in the hard-hit communities of Sendai City, Rikuzentakata, and Ishinomaki, providing ongoing support to heal the trauma inflicted by the disaster. <br><br> <br><br>Over the past 55 years Ashinaga has raised over $1 billion (USD) to enable about 110,000 orphaned students to access higher education in Japan.",

      "The Sathirakoses Nagapradipa Foundation (SNF) was founded by Thai intellectual, writer and social critic, Sulak Sivaraksa, in 1969. SNF is one of the first social organisations set up in Thailand - with a broad mission of supporting struggling artists and writers, and facilitating educational, cultural and spiritual activities that encourage detachment from consumerism. Named after two prominent writers and scholars of Thai culture, the foundation has acted as an umbrella for a number of sister organisations, which have sprung up under its auspices, through the encouragement and support of Sulak Sivaraksa. Together, they have been working modestly for social transformation and an end to structural violence, as well as promoting peace and justice in the region.<br><br>What distinguishes SNF and its sister organisations from other social organisations is a deep commitment to social change through combining spirituality with social action. This approach is guided by the practice of 'engaged spirituality'.<br><br>The main objectives of the foundation are as follows -<br><br>(1) To support and promote persons who create art and cultural work, and to promote any activity which makes progress in the fields of arts and culture.<br><br>(2) To support and give assistance in activities which will bring about the progress of Thai literature and arts.<br><br>(3) To support and promote the conservation and/or development of arts, culture, education, as well as environmental and antiquity preservation for the progress of humanity.<br><br>(4) To publish news concerning domestic and international issues.<br><br>(5) To support and collaborate in social work for the benefit of society.<br><br>(6) To support and promote all work of the foundation without political aims.<br><br>The following is the broad organizational structure of SNF -<br><br>Patronage<br><br>SNF is under the patronage of His Holiness the Dalai Lama<br><br>SNF Sister Organizations<br><br>Wongsanit Ashram<br>Santi Pracha Dhamma Institute (SPDI)<br>International Network of Engaged Buddhists (INEB)<br>INEB Institute<br>School for Wellbeing - Studies and Research<br>Spirit in Education Movement (SEM)<br><br>Social Enterprises<br><br>Suan Ngen Mee Ma Publishing House and Social Enterprise<br>Siam Baandin Natural Housebuilding Social Enterprise<br><br>SNF is closely associated with -<br><br>Foundation for Children and Moo Baan Dek (Children's Village School)<br>Buddhika<br>Suksit Siam and Kled Thai Publishing Houses<br>Komol Keemthong Foundation<br>Institute for Contemplative Learning<br>Sekhivadhamma <br><br>Areas of engagement<br><br>Some key themes being addressed through the foundation and its sister organisations include:<br><br>Alternative Economics <br><br>Through the School for Wellbeing, SNF is collaborating with the Centre for Bhutan Studies and Chulalongkorn University on theoretical and practical applications of Gross National Happiness in Thailand. Two social enterprises have also grown out from the Foundation, providing models of social engagement that contribute to new paradigm thinking and sustainability.<br> <br>Art and Culture <br><br>SNF continues to support local artists in their contribution to commentary on social and political issues, aesthetics, and their own personal journeys of exploration and expression. INEB is also supporting the rediscovery and exchange of Buddhist art traditions across the Mekong region and beyond.  <br><br>Youth Activism <br><br>INEB's Young Bodhisattva programme includes exchange of youth among partner organizations, and a foundational Socially Engaged Buddhism training integrating spirituality with social analysis. <br><br>Strengthening Civil Society <br><br>Grassroots empowerment has been a foundational approach across many of the programmes under SNF's organisations. The Assembly of the Poor - a social movement representing vast networks of grassroots people across Thailand - continues to be supported through the Santi Pracha Dhamma Institute (SPDI). Both the Spirit in Education Movement (SEM) Laos and Myanmar programmes focus on grassroots empowerment, community organizing and public awareness raising as a means to strengthen capacities of civil society and create platforms for social change. <br><br>Sustainable Living and Environmental Integrity <br><br>Wongsanit Ashram is a core member of Global Ecovillage Network - Asia and Oceania, and with its partners, has facilitated the International Ecovillage Design Education training since 2007, which seeks to provide models for sustainable community living.  The 'Towards Organic Asia' programme under the School for Wellbeing also focuses on sustainability and wellbeing of communities through supporting organic agriculture farming and mindful markets across the Mekong region and Bhutan. INEB is also involved in recent initiatives on interfaith approaches to Climate Change and biodiversity conservation, which seek to bring a moral voice to the growing urgency for action to stem the current climate crisis. <br><br>Gender <br><br>SPDI and the Assembly of the Poor continue to organize capacity building activities for women groups within the network. INEB also contributes long-term thematic work on gender regarding women's' ordination and women's empowerment across Asia. <br><br>Peace and Justice <br><br>The 'Cross-Ethnic Integration in Andaman' project is working with migrant workers from Myanmar, including upholding and advocating migrant worker rights at policy and practical levels, and building trust and solidarity among migrant workers and local communities through cultural and social celebrations. INEB and its partners have collaborated on peace and justice initiatives in the Asian region for decades. Over the last years, focus has been on roles of the Buddhist Sangha in communal violence in Myanmar, Sri Lanka and restorative justice for Tamils during and after the civil war, and the impacts of the devastating Fukushima disaster of 2011. <br><br>Alternative Education <br><br>SEM Thailand works specifically on empowerment education for the Thai public, focusing mainly on inner growth and relationship building; and with organisations, government agencies, universities and private businesses to build workplace environments that support wellbeing. Under SEM Myanmar, the Coalition for the Promotion of Monastic Education is supporting local schools to become more open and democratic in their management, alongside encouraging holistic child-centred learning, engaging  parents, and breaking the walls which separate the school, monastery and community by becoming starting points for wider community-driven development.<br> <br>Media <br><br>SNF continually publishes books and magazines in both English and Thai languages, including the long-running Pacasaraya magazine, Puey magazine (in memory of Dr. Puey Ungpakhorn), and the Seeds of Peace. SEM Laos has also continued providing materials in Lao language on Buddhism and social engagement.",

      "Foundation for the Support of Women's Work (FSWW), established in 1986, is a non-profit, non-governmental organization. It supports grassroots women's leadership throughout Turkey and empowers them in improving the quality of their lives and of their communities. It works with formal or informal women groups in a principled partnership and collaborates with other sectors. The FSWW has Public interest status and tax exemption.   The FSWW believes that women's empowerment is not a sole economic issue.  It requires strategies integrating transfer of economic resources and democratic participation at all levels, elimination of gender discrimination and exclusion from cultural, political and social arena.  The FSWW adopts an empowerment approach of supporting women's bottom-up organizing efforts around their practical needs and building greater self reliance and confidence to meet their more strategic gender issues. Based on this approach, the main empowerment strategies of FSWW are,   Provision of public spaces for grassroots women to operate ,  Capacity building to support  grassroots women's organizing efforts and social and livelihood initiatives, and involvement in local governance,  Dialogue and negotiation processes to build strategic partnerships at local and national level for resources and recognition,   Dissemination of learnings & experience through Networking and Peer Exchanges and publications. FSWW'S WORKING PRINCIPLES  *Recognizes the grassroots women's expertise and their power in struggling with poverty and building their lives and their communities, and their rights to define and solve their problems.  *Respects grassroots women's own values and avoids alienating them from themselves and their communities.  *Believes that equal participation of women in social, economic and political decision making process can only be realized at community and local level, seeks cooperation of local governments and other actors in the society.  * Works with grassroots women groups in solidarity as equal partners and its programs are rooted in synergy of women. FSWW PROGRAMS  FSWW works with grassroots women groups at local level and carries out the following programs in cooperation with them: 1- Early Child Care and Education Program  FSWW develops alternative ways in expanding early child care and education services to low-income communities, through the leadership and advocacy role of grassroots women.  With an educational approach bringing the children, families, educators and the community together, women cooperatively manage high quality early childcare and education programs. This program is accredited by Vanderbilt University (USA).  Based on the local needs and the resources, child care and education services are provided through:  Parent-managed Day Care Centers: Community mothers establish and run community based child care and education centers for children of 3-6 years and cooperate with public and other relevant agencies.   Neighborhood Mothers: Experienced mothers are trained to provide child care and education services to 3-4 young children at their own homes. Play Rooms: Children are provided with collective spaces arranged for learning thoroughly play and creative activities under the control of their mothers.   2- Collective Capacity Building and Organizing Program  FSWW's participatory and process oriented approach aims to strengthen grassroots' women's capacity and networking to identify and produce solutions to their common problems, develop self-advocacy skills and become active partners in the local decision making process through such tools;  Training :Participatory training programs   on such issues as Leadership, Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship, Basic IT Skills, Political Participation, etc)  are developed  to provide women   the skills and knowledge   in dealing with the issues they concern. Study Tours:  New groups are provided to study and learn about good practices of mature groups dealing with similar issues.   Exchange Meetings: Grassroots women groups are brought together in peers to share their experiences and to learn from each other at local, national and international level.  Leadership and Organizing support:  Through this program, women groups are trained and supported to increase their leadership skills and organize around their strategic needs and turn into independent, registered local organizations.  Through this program, the FSWW achieved to create a grassroots women's movement and created more than 110 women cooperatives all around Turkey. It has also brought these cooperatives in a network and established a formal Union of Women Cooperatives, and started a policy advocacy process for more favorable environment for women cooperatives in areas of tax, registration and access to public resources issues, and recognition as social businesses. The FSWW through its Cooperative Support Center provides women cooperatives technical assistance, consultancy and program support including training of trainers for dissemination of FSWW programs, organizational strategic planning, business development, marketing, etc.  It also provides networking and knowledge sharing platforms through web portals and peer exchange meetings, regional and national meetings. These cooperatives engaged in providing  community based child care services, training and capacity building for community women, running economic enterprises and  building negotiation processes with the local decision makers, reaching  annually around 100 000 women. Dialogue Building Meetings: FSWW helps local women cooperatives to come together with other sectors (municipalities, public agencies, universities and other NGOs) for information sharing, visibility, recognition and accessing to resources. In this framework, the FSWW piloted a Gender Based Local Budget analysis and provided the grassroots women with a tool based on \"rights\" to negotiate with the local governments for resource allocation to their priorities.  3- Economic Empowerment Programs  FSWW initiated the following programs in order to build women's capacity for economic involvement. Business and Product Development: Training and monitoring support is provided  to enable women to develop business ideas by analyzing the existing local economic and market opportunities and their own skills, and new products with market potential are developed and women's skills are improved accordingly. Micro Credit: FSWW has established a micro credit institution, MAYA. As the first micro credit program of Turkey, it provides credit to women to start or improve their small businesses, till now distributed more than 11.700 loans.  Marketing/ Shop: FSWW established a shop at the ground floor of its own building in Istanbul, where various kinds of products (handmade accessories, decorations etc.) produced by individual women producers and women cooperatives from all around Turkey. The women's products are also marketed through internet on the shop's web site and other e-commerce sites.  FSWW also created second hand bazaar under the same name, with local branches run by women initiatives, the profit of which together with Nahl shop, goes to support collective initiatives to run community based child care services.   4- Women and Disaster Program: From Disaster to Development  The FSWW has actively involved in the post disaster efforts after the 17 August 1999 earthquake. It has managed to set up eight Women and Children centers' in the region, which are run by women themselves. FSWW enabled women to move from being victims of disaster to active participants in transferring their communities from disaster areas to development. They organized in 6 registered independent organizations working in issues like governance, housing and reconstruction, economic initiatives/sustainability and child care and other community services, additional to a housing cooperative of women.  Since 1999, FSWW is cooperating with other organizations  in India, Iran, Indonesia  etc. with similar experiences  as a part of global working group on \"Women and Disaster\", in order to influence the policies of governments, multinational development and humanitarian agencies  to turn  a \"disaster\" into an opportunity for sustainable community development.  Based on its experience in post disaster efforts, the FSWW recently started a piloting project in Istanbul cooperating with Istanbul Technical University, for community disaster preparedness under the leadership of women.",

      "Ladies' Turn is working at the grassroots level, organizing football matches in the hearts of Senegalese neighborhoods, to give Senegalese girls and women their turn to play.  While football is extremely popular in Senegal, it is considered a men's sport, meaning that most girls do not have an opportunity to play.  Girls also face disparities in the educational system: while primary education for girls in Senegal has made significant gains, most girls never complete secondary school.  <br><br>To change this reality, Ladies' Turn aims to: <br>i.) Expand opportunities for girls to play soccer. <br>ii.) Promote girl's education and personal development.<br>iii.) Promote gender equality through soccer.                                                                                   <br><br>By expanding opportunities for girls to play soccer, Ladies' Turn also seeks to promote gender equality and women's empowerment.  By presenting women in roles as athletes, Ladies' Turn works to challenge traditional gender roles.  Soccer also presents a unique opportunity to contribute positively to girls' self confidence and personal development.  The players who participate in Ladies' Turn activities make lasting friendships and cultivate relationships with significant mentor figures such as coaches.  In addition to soccer matches, Ladies' Turn is piloting activities to encourage girls to stay in school and promote sports and education.  Ladies' Turn believes that soccer is a powerful tool for development.",

It was formed in 2015 by ordinary Irish citizens in response to the humanitarian crisis in the Aegean Sea when thousands of people were arriving by boat, having been displaced by war, conflict, and persecution. In Greece, our crew and volunteers saved over 15,000 people in distress. After being forced to suspend operations for 9 months, we are operating once again, in partnership with the rescue organisation Sea-Eye. Our life-saving rescue vessel, named Mo Chara (meaning 'my friend' in Irish) forms a crucial part of the Sea-Eye 4 ship. <br><br>Our small and dedicated team is made up of a few core staff and many committed volunteers who work tirelessly to keep Mo Chara afloat. We share the same values of diversity, equality, integrity, respect and transparency that guide us. And none of our missions would have been possible without the generosity of hundreds of donors and partners who have enabled us to save lives.

To further optimise their previously successful work, the participating organisations bring together their many years of experience in humanitarian aid abroad.  In exceptional cases, Aktion Deutschland Hilft is also active at home. The idea of integrating their respective knowledge and specific abilities, and through mutual extension to efficiently bundle measures for aid, unites the continued independent initiators of this mutual campaign. Overlapping and gaps in provision can already be avoided in the forefront of aid campaigns in this way.  During the acute phase of a catastrophe abroad, Aktion Deutschland Hilft turns to the public with a mutual appeal for funds. Germany's Relief Coalition appeals for funds appear under the account number 102030 at the Bank fur Sozialwirtschaft. The existing administrative structures and capacities of the member organisations help to lower costs and to use directly the highest possible share of the collected donations for aid.  Distribution of the donation monies takes place via a key that takes into account the capacity and capacity profile of the respective participating relief organisations.  Successful examples for this system that is to be implemented by Germany's Relief Coalition exist in Great Britain and Switzerland. The Disaster Emergency Committee and the Swiss Gluckskette verify that a united approach when confronting large catastrophes eases the work of the helpers.",

      'There are about 23.000 children in Hungary who live in the child care system. Vilagszep foundation helps disadvantaged children in child protection care for more than 10 years. During our work we concluded that material donations alone are not the real help to these children, but rather a safety net, individual attention and stability.<br><br>We organize specialised programmes that best fit the young age, the situation and the goals of these children, and so our activities are wide ranging and multi-faceted. In light of this our activity consists of five main programs for foster children: 1. individual mentoring program 2. storytelling workshops in orphanages 3. summer camps 4. inclusive private kindergarten 5. inclusive kid\'s centre. <br>Our programs help our supported children believe that they too have a place in this world, they deserve to be loved and that they too have opportunities awaiting them just like any other child - despite a difficult start.<br><br>Our programmes aim to:<br><br>- develop their self-esteem and confidence,<br>- empower them to take responsibility,<br>- learn to accept and love themselves.<br><br>As a result:<br><br>- the incidence of deviant behaviour is reduced,<br>- they can build more accepting and supportive relationships,<br>- there is a higher rate of successful completion of their studies<br>- they are able to find jobs and create their own homes<br>- and avoid repeating their fate.<br><br>However we cannot help to everyone, the impact of our work is a significant increase in the proportion of happy and successful young people who follow social norms, which can lead to significant social savings (e.g. more taxpaying citizens, fewer prison places, less unemployment benefits, less education or health spending, etc.).<br><br>Our organisation focuses on overall well-being of children. We believe that caring for children, nurturing, teaching and protecting them physically and mentally is a high priority for every society. Caring ensures children to have access to a variety of resources, as well as felt loved, build confidence, gain knowledge, and have the possibility to unfold their abilities.<br>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has been in force in Hungary since 1991. Among others, the Convention recognizes that each child has the right to a family or protection, and a life free from discrimination. It is our mission to support these goals within our society by real acts and provide effective and professional lifelong help to "our children" where and as they need it the most.',

To make the whole concept attractive and child friendly, the society requested the Pakistan Road Transport Board to donate a Double Decker bus in which a library could be set up. Books were donated and soon afterwards the first Book Bus Library became functional.<br><br>The idea proved to be a roaring success. Consequently to ensure provision of maximum benefit to the most vulnerable focus was placed on children enrolled in Government schools, whereas to widen the ambit of work the number of libraries was increased over time.  Of these, the first set up in the double decker bus is a Stationed Bus Library, the second a Reference Library set up in a building, and the 2 Mobile Libraries and 3 rickshaw libraries for facilitating those children who cannot visit either of the above. <br><br>From the time of its registration under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 in January 1979 till date, Alif Laila has focused on bringing books and children closer through setting up libraries small and big, in communities and in schools as well as its mobile library program.  <br><br>However, at the same time the organization has added interventions its portfolio that are congruent to its overall mission and vision. <br><br>We focus on 6 main areas: 1) Access to quality children books; 2) Hands on learning <br>3) Teacher development; 4) Youth and women empowerment; 5) Public-private partnership; 6)  Advocacy and 7)  Development of ECE materials and children's books<br><br> Scope of Work<br>1. Access To Quality Children Books<br><br>Alif Laila is committed to targeting early literacy as the foundation of all other learning as an urgent priority. It has developed Pakistan's only comprehensive   program to help our youngest citizens access quality children books. Alif Laila also believes in opening minds of our young ones through reading, a trait essential for any society to  progress and have peace. In Lahore the unique library complex hosts Pakistan's pioneer children library and first mobile library. The mobile library program consists of 2 custom made small vehicles  and a  rickshaw. These mobile libraries serve low income communities as well as government schools. Rickshaw library is used for narrow streets. With the help of sponsors and donors we establish libraries of all sizes and shapes all over Pakistan, in schools and in communities. We focus on Pakistan's remote areas as well as communities  in Gilgit-Baltistan.<br><br><br>2. Writing, printing and publishing children's books and Issue based books/posters<br><br>1.

Its mission is to collaborate in the construction of a just, inclusive and caring society through the participatory elaboration of comprehensive technology-based projects; promote engineering geared towards sustainable human development, the fulfillment of Human Rights, the care of nature and the strengthening of populations in vulnerable situations; and promote a space that integrates diversity and mobilizes citizen participation.<br> <br>The problems to which ISF-Ar responds are situations of social vulnerability in communities characterized by isolation and the absence of the Government. These situations are answered with infrastructure works, whether it be construction and expansion of community infrastructure, such as kindergartens, community spaces and schools, or water supply systems. On the other hand, a response is given by convening the state and other social actors in order to make visible and articulate work networks that strengthen these territories.<br> <br>The strategic priorities of the next three years include 1) Deepening the impact on local development, professionalizing territorial work and coordinating with other social organizations, municipalities and public bodies 2) Increasing the scope and scale of the water access program in rural communities 3) Promote the strengthening program for organizations through community infrastructure and advisory programs 4) Design and implement an intervention strategy in confinement contexts 5) Promote advocacy on public policies and participation in spaces for debate and decision-making in the areas of interest of the organization 6) Systematize and produce knowledge about the experiences, methodologies and topics addressed such as engineering social impact, gender perspective, Infrastructure and human rights, participatory design and climate crisis.<br> <br>The challenges to achieve the objectives are the formation of a professional interdisciplinary team to address social complexity, as well as the economic sustainability of the organization to be able to engage in long-term projects in the territories in a stable way as well as to expand the scale of the interventions. Another great challenge is the articulation with the State, which in many cases depends on the current political scenario. For the objective of producing knowledge and influencing spaces for debate, one challenge is to obtain funds that allow for further study in this regard.',

      "Diapalante believes that in any community, there is the understanding and expertise to identify and solve many local issues. In Senegal and Mauritania, United Nations least developed countries, it is often poverty and its consequences that hold back development. Diapalante's mission is to work with our long-term local partners in Africa to enable them to create projects that bring sustainable, realistic and effective improvement to the lives of their fellow citizens.<br>Since 2005 Diapalante has carried out community-led development projects in Mauritania and Senegal, West Africa. Our role is to listen to our long-term local partners, Diapalante Senegal and Diapalante Mauritanie respectively, then through discussion and research select projects where our objectives, expertise and resources combine with theirs to produce a sustainable positive impact. Diapalante is a partnership - sharing knowledge and expertise. Where we can, in the UK and abroad, we use local volunteers but in Senegal the Diapalante Community Education Centre also employs three staff to enable the programme and a premises to function efficiently. All projects are delivered by our local partners in collaboration with the local community. These partnerships are the core of our work.  <br>We have set up a range of projects in Mauritania which now operate independently. These include a workshop and training to enable people with disabilities to earn a living making shoes and clothing, a programme implemented in several towns to address the health needs of children who live by begging on the street, and a cattle vaccination park to improve the sustainability of the livelihoods of nomadic herders. <br>In Senegal we work with our partner Diapalante Senegal, to develop and deliver various educational projects under the umbrella of the Diapalante Community Education Centre which is located in Kaolack, one of Senegal's largest cities. The Diapalante Community Education Centre opened in 2010 as a drop-in Centre offering \"Education for All\" regardless of age or background. The Centre helps people gain the skills they need to succeed in education, work and life. Open in the mornings then from mid-afternoon though to 9pm the Centre allows people to attend around school, work and family commitments.<br>The UN Human Development Index (2019) shows Senegal's population has an average of only 3.2 years of education and a literacy rate of 52% in adults. Enrolment in primary school has risen to 81% with 40% dropping out before completing primary education and 44% of children going on to enrol in secondary school. After a short initial period the teaching language in school is French (the national language) though this is no-ones mother tongue. This is a barrier to progress particularly for those children whose parents, having little education themselves, do not speak French. <br>Diapalante addresses the great need for education and training opportunities which help children to thrive in school, give basic literacy and numeracy skills to children not in school or give adults the opportunity to gain skills useful in the workplace. The programme at the Diapalante Community Education Centre reflects both the strengths of the staff and volunteer teachers and the needs expressed by the community<br>This year the Centre has 500 beneficiaries of which 250 attend the Centre's regular lessons and activities and an additional 250 children are in \"outreach\" projects. The Centre premises has a teaching yard, a small classroom, a stockroom, a computer room and a library. It is run by the Centre co-ordinator (Mamadou Kane aka Master P), assisted by two local staff, 2 British gap-year volunteers (not currently available due to COVID) and many local volunteers. The Centre's teaching programme is outlined below: <br>Young Leaders Programme<br>The successful teenage Young Leaders program trains young volunteers to run after-school French learning activities for small groups of primary school children. The Young Leaders grow in confidence as they gain skills in self-organisation, communication and presentation of ideas and management of others in a calm and positive manner while reaching set teaching objectives. Their commitment through the year is acknowledged in a certificate awarded annually, a greatly prized part of their portfolio illustrating to employers their skills and experience of both leadership and teamwork. <br><br>Learning Boost: French after school activity primary school children<br>Our project addresses the problem that French is the language of teaching in Senegal but not anyone's mother tongue. The lack of French skills is generally most marked in children whose parents have least education and so are less able to help their children gain the skills needed to succeed in school.<br>This after-school project is attended by 160 primary school children. Our teenage Young Leaders each encourage a small group of children to practice their French skills while completing a variety of games, reading and craft activities. <br>Analysis of school exam performance showed the 150 children who attended the pilot year of this after-school activity showed a significantly improved overall performance in their end of year exams by comparison with their peer group.<br><br>Literacy for street children (talibes)<br>A proportion of the children who do not enrol in primary school are talibes. These are boys who study the Koran and reside in koranic schools known as daaras. We have encountered starkly different attitudes and styles of running daaras which range from children living in the most deprived of conditions, who beg for their food and have little or no family contact, widely condemned as modern slavery, through to the modern daaras which offer education comparable with private boarding schools. <br>This pilot programme gives talibes basic skills which help them towards a sustainable future. Sixty talibes learn to read and write in their mother tongue. They also become competent in the basics of maths and occasionally do STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, maths) activities.<br> <br>English<br>With a Centre co-ordinator who is fluent in English and 2 British volunteers our project is well placed to teach English. English language skills are useful for local jobs, West African trade and international trade. English lessons are popular with adults and schoolchildren. <br><br>Computer literacy<br>Being able to use a computer is a valuable skill in the search for office work in Senegal today. This learning is available to those in the best private schools. The computer skills programme at Diapalante redresses this, giving our members the skills to take jobs where computers are used. The course follows the French curriculum for computer literacy (Brevet) and ability is assessed online. Success gives a certificate of achievement.<br> <br>Library<br>We have a small library at the Diapalante Centre and this has an important role in introducing the value of books as both a learning resource and a leisure resource. Textbooks are generally shared and well-worn and book ownership is not commonplace so we are slowly building up a reference section of good copies.<br><br>Other activities<br>There are other activities and subjects which are offered by volunteers on a short or long-term basis including maths, French grammar, STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and maths), preparation for work, environmental issues, citizenship. <br>The Centre passes surplus donated computer stock to the education authority in Kaolack.<br>We plan to expand the Centre's outreach and activities as opportunities permit.<br><br>The Diapalante Community Education Centre: Possible future plans include:<br>1. Ensure funding of the current projects<br>2. Programme for women and girls<br>a. Explore options and need to teach reproductive health and family planning<br>b. Research period poverty - is there a serious problem?<br>c. Trial the acceptability of re-usable menstrual pads.<br>d. Enterprise training: creating re-usable menstrual pads<br>3. A more appropriate building for the Centre<br>The current ground floor apartment has served the Centre well but is now limiting its activities and outreach.<br><br>We also work with The Hillcrest Advisory Bureau and Bursary Fund in South Africa who support the underpriviledged community within the Valley of 1000 Hills near Hillcrest in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa by providing advice and access to education. We work together to develop their support of educational access to university and vocational courses. The in-country funding of this part of their programme was particularly hit by the financial effects of COVID19 so this year we have been involved in fundraising to sustain this work through the pandemic.",

Of course the staff there do their best to offer a good care, however, sometimes it is not enough to comfort them.<br><br>When these people spend time with dogs, those animals soothe and ease the mind, bringing out a smile from the people. People with physical disabilities or restricted movements try to move close to a dog too. They are often so touched as to shed a tear. Among those who have experienced the time with these dogs, some say "I\'m truly looking forward to seeing the dog again," and spend their days waiting for the next meeting.<br><br>In order to offer this healing contact with dogs to the many people who eagerly await it, in November 2009, we acquired the authentication from Japanese government to found JATA (Specified Nonprofit Corporation Japan Animal Therapy Association). It is run thanks to the cooperation of all our members, and we endeavor to spread animal therapy work throughout the country and the world.<br><br>We work with therapy dogs to provide contact with therapy dogs to all those who desire it.<br>We would like to build a bridge that links the hearts of people and dogs.',

    description:
      "CyprusInno (operated by BD-SS Way Forward for Cyprus Innovation) is a nonprofit organisation founded by a mixed Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot team who have overcome decades of social and geographical division to create the first and largest cross-border platform connecting entrepreneurs on the divided island of Cyprus. Founded in late-2016, our organization operates a platform of digital tools and live events that utilizes a novel method of entrepreneurship as a mechanism for peacebuilding. As a mixed Cypriot team and citizens of a divided nation, we constantly wondered how we can actually build sustainable peace through innovative means.  Our social venture, CyprusInno, challenges the division in Cyprus by creating a platform whereby all Cypriots can work together towards a peaceful and prosperous future while building a collaborative entrepreneurial ecosystem. CyprusInno uses entrepreneurship as a peace-building mechanism and entrepreneurs and peacemakers, and we ultimately built what we call and island-wide ecosystem with over 3,000 members and over 40 partners on both sides of the island. We host live inter-communal trainings, mentorship programmes, networking events, hackathons, panel events, etc.<br><br>Our mission is to bring young social entrepreneurs together in post-conflict regions such as Cyprus to build sustainable social businesses together and, as a result, sustainable peace to enable social and economic development.<br><br>We realize our mission through our hybrid digital, live events, and physical space platform model. Through this model, we've seen success both through our digital engagement, our live engagement (such as the largest inter-communal networking events in our island's history), social metrics through cross-border engagements and business collaborations, and our favorite, over 260,000 euros in value created through cross-border collaborations. <br><br>This year, we moved into historic 4-piece container located within the UN-controlled Buffer Zone on the border between both sides of the island, which we transformed from a military base into what we call a Social Impact Generator. The Base by CyprusInno is the first innovative space of its kind in the world located in a demilitarized zone on the border of both sides of the island and it combines the elements of a coworking center, meeting/office space, accelerator/incubator, innovation center, and multimedia studio. It is located on the grounds of the historic Ledra Palace in Cyprus' UN Buffer Zone, now headquarters of the UN Peace Keeping Forces in Cyprus Sector Two, in the divided capital city of Nicosia. The Base by CyprusInno is a Social Impact Generator, where multiple players in our innovation ecosystem come together to co-create solutions to real world problems, thus leading to social impact and economic development and sustainable peace.<br><br>The Base aims to establish a peaceful and interactive space in the Buffer Zone that maximizes cooperation via entrepreneurship all while facilitating the formation of intercommunal startup that create social impact.  We host a variety of programming including a social startup accelerator, co-working, resident startup teams, mentorship, events, and more, all with people from both sides of the island. <br><br>The Base is a 4-part military container that we transformed into an innovation space, by hand using upcycling methods, and with support of the local community. It can be accessed by entering Cyprus's neutral zone from either side, and it features a coworking center and events space with a stage, custom coworking tables, catering, brainstorming lounge with writeable walls, a soundproof multimedia studio, a boardroom, and an office space.<br><br>Our mission here is to transform Cyprus' dead zone into a creative space that empowers youth from rival communities to take control of their future as we battle a deepening division. The Base features a co-working room (events stage, locally built coworking table and high-top tables, brainstorming area with writeable walls, catering corner), a studio with recording capabilities, an office space for resident teams, and a board room. <br><br>Here's our deck with a virtual tour: https://cyprusinno.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The-Base-by-CyprusInno-Overview_2021_vF-2.pdf",

Our mission is to change the image<br>of first-generation students, support them in accessing higher education and succeeding in their academic<br>pathways.<br><br>ArbeiterKind.de started as a website in 2008 and was registered in 2009 as a non-profit organization. The<br>charitable purpose is the promotion of university education for students of parents without university<br>degrees. <br><br>The success of ArbeiterKind.de is based on a countrywide network of about 6.000 volunteer<br>mentors in 80 nationwide 80 groups who are usually first-generation university students themselves. They<br>encourage others and fulfill a role model function through their own educational story, offering local and<br>accessible support for high school students and parents. <br><br>Since 2008 Arbeiterkind.de has support several<br>hundreds of thousands of first generation students.<br>ArbeiterKind.de makes its services available without a lot of bureaucracy, with a low threshold and locally<br>relevant for all students throughout Germany interested in going to university. It enables people with different<br>biographical, religious/cultural backgrounds and worldviews whose futures are connected to educational<br>advancement to find mutual support and give each other strength. ArbeiterKind.de can reach its target group<br>because the volunteers from ArbeiterKind.de usually belong to the target group.<br><br>Arbeiterkind.de helps develop a positive identity among its target group by emphasizing strengths rather<br>than highlighting stigma as "kids whose parents never went to university." <br>There is little culture of celebrating<br>the pioneer in Germany. There is no favorable German translation for "first-generation Student" (the most<br>common translation would be the "Nichtakademikerkind / Child of Non-Academics"). You rarely see<br>someone mentioning being a first-generation student in a CV or a public speech. It is something people tend<br>to hide, there is very little pride. It is therefore essential to change the image of first-generation students in<br>Germany and highlight their strengths and unique skills set.<br><br>Young people from families whose parents did not go to college who overcome the hurdles they face and<br>master the transition to the next higher educational stage demonstrate courage, perseverance and strength.<br>That kind of potential is essential for the economy and society.<br><br>Why ArbeiterKind.de?<br>The problem<br><br>The number of those studying in Germany has been rising continuously for years to its current level of nearly<br>2.9 million. Family background continues to be the decisive factor in a young person\'s decision of whether to<br>go on to college. <br>In a study on university attendance in Germany, the German Center for Higher Education<br>Research and Science Studies (DZHW) found the following: of every 100 children from families with parents<br>who went to college, 79 started college, while out of every 100 children from families with parents who did<br>not go to college, only 27 decided to go to college.<br><br>The social selection continues at the universities as well: 63 students from families with parents who went to<br>college achieved bachelor\'s degrees, 45 master\'s degrees, and 10 attained a doctorate. But only 15<br>students from families with parents who did not go to college attained a bachelor\'s degree, 8 a master\'s, and<br>only one person attained a doctorate. (source: University Education Report 2020, a study of the association<br>in cooperation with McKinsey, 2017)<br><br>Parents with no university experience tend to prefer vocational training and fast financial independence for<br>their child. The longer and more expensive path of college is frequently not an option, and the question of<br>finances plays a decisive role. In the case of many families, the child is not encouraged to take out loans<br>within the context of the German Federal Training Assistance Act (BAfoG). Scholarships as a means of<br>financing are not well known, and applying for one would only carry a small chance of success. <br>In addition,<br>the performance requirements for a college degree are often unclear or assumed to be too high. Those who<br>still dare to take the next step and get into a university often need more time and energy to acclimate. The<br>social setting at a university is very complex, the academic habits, the academic way of behaving and the<br>use of language can be foreign. <br>All of these factors can lead to insecurity from the start, which carries through everyday student life until they finish.<br><br>The Solution<br><br>The success of ArbeiterKind.de is based on a countrywide network of volunteer mentors who are generally<br>first generation college students themselves. Through their own educational stories, they encourage others<br>and fulfill a role model function, offering local needs-oriented and easily accessible support for high school<br>students and parents.<br><br>ArbeiterKind.de makes its services available without a lot of bureaucracy, with a low threshold and right<br>there locally for all students throughout Germany who are interested in going to college.

The foundation assists women, refugees, ethnic minorities, and disadvantaged groups with their questions, struggles and needs, as they are formulated within their own terms. Academic research is the first step in this process because it helps to gain insight into local beliefs, practices and ambitions. The key areas of We women's engagement include personal growth, social inclusion, (mental) health, education, and the encouragement of creative initiatives, with the ultimate goal of achieving equality for all.\nThe We women foundation has been based in Chiang Mai, Thailand, since 2010, where we have been developing and implementing the We women from Burma Project. This project promotes the education and well-being of unrecognized refugee women from Burma. The Foundation targets women whose passions, goals and motivations implicate them as future leaders of Burma. We women provides a much needed service to women from Burma by offering them the opportunity to succeed in higher education. Each year the We women foundation supports a select number of qualified women as they prepare themselves for leadership in their country and communities. We women assists students as they prepare themselves for university by advising them during the application process and throughout their job search. During each woman's period of study, the We women foundation provides scholarship funding for their university tuition, as well as academic tutoring and coaching. In order to provide long-term support, We women assists its alumni in their search for positions as they enter the professional world.\n\nThe long-term aim of the We women from Burma project is to assist unrecognized refugee women into obtaining higher positions within policy making or influential organizations so that they then can empower other women and their communities, on their own terms.In order to realise our long-term objective, the We women foundation intends to make higher education accessible for the future female leaders of Burma. In addition, we assist them where possible in the process of professional development. To this end we have developed a number of short-term goals: \n To ensure prospective students have the necessary qualifications and documentation to be admitted to a university of their choice, so they can make well informed and realistic decisions about their future education.  \n To grant scholarships to the most promising students, so they can successfully enroll at the university of their choice and not experience financial restraints while completing their degrees. \n To support and coach students during their studies at university, so they can successfully complete their degree and gain all the theoretical knowledge they need for their future careers. \n To create opportunities for students to gain practical working experience in an internship setting, so they can put their education and theoretical knowledge into practice, build their credentials and further develop practical expertise.\n To assist alumni in obtaining key positions in policy making and influential organizations. \n To research community needs in order to improve existing programs and create new programs with research results. \n To provide a gender program that addresses gender issues in the community in order to promote gender equality and create a platform for women leaders.\n\nThese goals are collectively addressed by our programs, which jointly make up the We women from Burma project.",

      'Teach For Taiwan (hereafter, TFT)  is a chartered non-profit organization that has been working towards the mission of providing youths from all academic disciplines in the country and from overseas to tackle educational inequality for children from low socioeconomic backgrounds at disadvantaged schools and communities. <br><br>TFT fellowship program recruits, trains, and supports talented graduates and professionals to teach in high-need schools for 2 years, and prepares them to be lifelong leaders dedicated to educational equity for Taiwan. TFT also seeks to build a network and pass on paradigms whereby the alumni (finished two-year program) and supporters are able to navigate their career path by making a long-term impact and drive a nationwide movement to solve the educational inequality problem.<br>     <br>TFT believes that each child should have equal rights and opportunity to realize his or her full potential, and that education should not be compromised by solvable problems. To this end, TFT has been working with schools, communities, like-minded organizations, businesses, and government to drive a nationwide movement. The systemic change TFT envisions not only entails success for children from all backgrounds, but also the collective consciousness of society advocating for a world with educational equity.',

PWK will send young Koreans to international cooperation sites and train them. Foreign NGOs who have entered Korea tend to stick to fundraising.

When young Koreans grow up solving various challenges at the international cooperation sites, they will be able to become the people who fit into the new era and lead our future.<br><br>3. PWK will support North Korea, which faces the worst situation in the world, but has unlimited potential. Instead of unilateral support, we are trying to help North Korea to promote co-prosperity as partners who will live together in East Asia. As history shows, symbiosis is the only way in East Asia.",

In 2007, CEMINA shifted its focus from radio to the capacity building for social start ups and education for adaptation to climate change. One of its main projects was Adapta Sertao, which  developed a social technology that benefits the population of small underserved towns in the semi-arid region of Brazil, articulating a group of social technologies that use scare resources such as water and arable land to guarantee the livelihoods of the local farming communities. The project received very prestigious awards such as the 2008 SEED Award. It has also been recognized as a best practice by UN Habitat.   In 2008, CEMINA developed a second agroecological program to restore de Atlantic Rainforest in the peripheral communities of Rio de Janeiro,  called Sinal do Vale. Since then, SINAL has grown to take prominence as a reference of sustainability solutions and environmental education in the region, hosting more than 4,000 change agents from all over the world and acting as a hub where innovative ideas are tested and scaled up.',

      "The International Blue Cross is one of the world's leading non-governmental organisations, caring for people harmed by or at risk from alcohol or illicit drug use.<br><br>Our project work in prevention, treatment & counselling and aftercare focuses primarily on young and vulnerable people, and on those in extreme poverty. Through carefully researched and targeted interventions we advocate for evidence-based alcohol policies at the national and international level. In doing so, we seek to draw positive and dignified attention to the issues faced by dependent people and their families.  Our Vision: We see a world where all people can knowingly choose and live a life free of harmful addiction; a world where all people harmed by addiction have access to and can benefit from high quality and holistic treatment.  Our Mission: We provide healthcare development support and promote holistic well-being; We prevent and reduce the harmful use of alcohol and illicit drugs and help mitigate the associated negative health, social, and economic consequences; We advocate for evidence and best practice-based alcohol policy formulation and implementation on the national and international levels.  Alcohol and illicit drug misuse afflicts innumerous individuals and families. It also costs societies around the world billions of dollars in health and socio-economic costs. This growing burden is worthy of everyone's attention. The International Blue Cross constitutes a credible and renowned organisation driven by the values, the sort of professionalism, governance, and local community connections needed to effectively address this global challenge.",

And when was the last time that the educational institutions consulted with the companies that are needed or missing in the market?<br>In Uruguay, technical education seeks to bridge this gap, the proposal of ANIMA with its modality, add value as it benefits not only young people living in vulnerable situations but also companies that are part of the training process of their future employees, visualizing this as a human resources policy.<br>Such training modality is an educational model of great value since it enables the integration of the company in young people\'s learning process, this builds a bond throughout the process that adds a didactical value to the work done in class; it is a resource of great demand both for students and teachers, which establishes a stronger commitment to their learning processes.    <br>Thus, students complete their Upper secondary education, the last compulsory educational cycle in Uruguay, with two years of work experience in occupational areas. As a result, their quality of life can be considerably better, and they can have more and better opportunities of employability.   <br>ANIMA is actually a big influence for public policies and achieve greater coverage due to we are a "benchmark" in our country and also in the region. We are invited to participate in talks, national and international events and workshops to narrate our experience. Also, the media has contacted us in several occasions as "leaders" of on the job training experience in our country.<br><br>The proposal of ANIMA has directly benefited 282 young people from a vulnerable context since 2016. In 2018, the first generation included 75 graduates. Currently, in 2020, we have 151 Upper secondary school students in 4th, 5th and 6th Form. Training practices in the different companies start in 5th Form; they consist of 12 hours per week on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2 pm to 6 pm. By 2020, we have create 175 training practices in more than 70 Training Companies. <br>This year the third generation will graduate from ANIMA. The strategic goal ANIMA has set for the next years is to consolidate its on on the job training experience (Dual Education System proposal), in order to prepare for a stage of growth, as well as the scheme\'s expansion both in public and private spheres.',

      'Tiempo de Juego is a non-profit entity that seeks to foster the adequate use of free time among children and youth in the most vulnerable areas of Colombia. The foundation seeks to distance children from the social ills that surround them and educate them through strategies such as sports and cultural activities. Tiempo de Juego\'s mission is to spawn social cohesion and development through sports, cultural, recreational, and formative tools whose purpose is the generation of competencies, promotion of values, and the effective use of free time in a responsible and conscientious manner, generating a positive and replicable impact towards a better quality of life for the community and its surroundings. <br><br>Tiempo de Juego was established in 2006, as a project for the "Communication for Development" program through the "Universidad de la Sabana". After an exhaustive study for more than three years in Cazuca, one of the most marginalized, deprived and violent areas of our country, it was detected that the lack of education and excess of time of the youth, and the fact about 70 percent of the population is classified displaced, was making them more vulnerable to joining different gangs, drug addiction, incurring early pregnancies, as well as being part of the armed outlaw groups that recruit them for very little money. <br>Using soccer as a recreational tool for value formation, accompanied by art workshops, cultural and educational courses, we gathered 400 children between 5 and 18, and the foundation began to inculcate the proper use of leisure time as a positive and useful way to encourage the kids into a brighter and more positive future.<br><br>Ever since Tiempo de Juego began to operate, the children and young people have changed as has the neighborhood environment. When they celebrate goals or they read a book, this does not seem the most depressing sector of Cundinamarca area, which according to official statistics, over the past 5 years, has had more than 850 murders of young people; this is the area with the highest rate of displacement population second to Choco. A zone where poverty and malnutrition, joining the gangs to participate in the conflict is just a daily experience, where those who are growing only aspire to be part of an armed group that inhabit the area.<br><br>Tiempo de Juego uses soccer as its main intervention tool to address social problems due to its capacity to convene people and its pedagogical possibilities. The foundation belongs to the football street world network, associated to the FIFA, and applies the FIFA approved rules of street football as the mechanism for the formation of values, formal education as a basis of democracy and the cultural workshops looking to build a fairer society. Also, we work out the values with the parents to achieve a proper family environment. <br><br>Since 2008, Tiempo de Juego has opened another chapter in Cartagena, Atlantic Cost City, making possible those children and youth of "Las Faldas de la Popa" also to receive these benefits and rights.',

      'Support disabled veterans and families of servicemen, who died serving their country. For the promise of peace, servicemen often make the ultimate sacrifice, leaving behind a family - parents, siblings, a wife and children. In addition to grieving and coping with the loss of a loved one, these families most often have to think of new living arrangements to forego rent, find additional employment to replace the main breadwinner and find ways to support the children and their eduction.<br>Disabled veterans are particularly vulnerable. Often, they are unable to concentrate on physical rehabilitation, mental improvement and adjusting to a new way of living, because they are acutely aware of the financial strain their inability to work put on their families. <br>The Insurance Foundation for Servicemen changes this dynamic, by providing financial assistance in the form of regular monthly installments for a period of 20 years.<br>This financial assistance is approximately in the amount of the average salary in Armenia and allows children to stay in school, mothers to spend time with their children, and disabled soldiers to concentrate on recuperation.  <br>The Foundation also recognizes the importance of education and increases compensations if the family includes a child studying at university.',

Conservation activities in habitats where wildlife is being threatened by human beings.  2. Conduct Education/awareness programs to alert people to wildlife issues & take actions that support coexistence of people & wild creatures, no matter the distance from the actual habitat. 3.

A county sports partnership is a network of key agencies committed to working together to increase participation in sport and physical activity.   Partners include national governing bodies of sport and their clubs, local authorities, sport and leisure facilities, public health, education, and many other non-sporting organisations.  Although county sports partnerships are funded through Sport England to deliver a range of specific services and programmes, Active Cumbria proactively engage with a much wider range of partners on a variety of services to benefit the people and communities of Cumbria.  Active Cumbria is supported in achieving its aims by a Partnership Steering Group and by a core team of professional staff who provide leadership, co-ordination and structures which allow people and organisations to work more effectively together at a sub-regional level. The Partnership and its core team are hosted within the Adult and Local Services Directorate of Cumbria County Council.  Active Cumbria believe that the partnership's priorities and cross cutting work areas have a vital contribution to make in achieving Cumbria County Council's and Adult and Local Services key priorities and aspirations. The Council's emphasis on supporting and improving the life chances of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of our community are reflected in our priorities and future work areas. These priorities contribute to achieving the outcomes identified in Active Cumbria's recently launched Strategy for Sport & Physical Activity covering the period 2013-17.  As articulated in its recently launched Strategy, Active Cumbria has a clear purpose, which is 'to work with all partners to achieve healthy and active communities in Cumbria through sport and physical activity'.   It is only through working together that the Partnership's vision of 'everyone in Cumbria has more opportunities to participate in sport and enjoy physical activity as an integral part of everyday life' will be achieved.  By continuing to work with key partners in an open, proactive, honest, and mutually beneficial way, Active Cumbria will ensure that its vision and purpose have the best opportunity to be achieved.",

We're dedicated to building a just and safer world focusing on people's rights. We're passionate about ending poverty and helping to rebuild the lives affected by it. It's an enormous undertaking but we also have people on our side - talented and committed partners, volunteers, supporters and staff who share the same values. We aim to save lives by responding quickly with aid and protection during emergencies, empower people to work their own way out of poverty and campaign for lasting change. We have been saving and changing lives for seventy years now and know that tackling poverty is only possible when we are helping people to secure their fundamental human rights - the right to life and security, the right to a sustainable livelihood, the right to essential services, the right to be heard and the right to equity (in particular, the rights of women). We work at all levels - global and local, with international governments and global institutions, local communities and individuals - to make sure that these rights are protected and that the best solutions to people's suffering are implemented. Our values as an organisation are founded upon our experiences. We know that poverty can only be overcome once the fundamental human rights of impoverished others are secured and our three main values as an organisation - empowerment, accountability, inclusiveness - reflect this. Empowerment - our approach means that everyone involved with Oxfam, from our staff and supporters to people living in poverty, should feel they can make change happen. Accountability - our purpose driven, results-focused approach means we take responsibility for our actions and hold ourselves accountable; we believe that others should also be held accountable for their actions. Inclusiveness - we are open to everyone and embrace diversity; we believe everyone has a contribution to make, regardless of visible and invisible differences.",

      'The Federation of Polish Food Banks is a public benefit organization whose mission since its establishment 20 years ago has been to prevent food waste and malnutrition in Poland. 31 Food Banks, which operate throughout the country form the Federation of Polish Food Banks. They are all NGOs with the status of an Association. Together, they form an Association with status of public benefit organization. The Federation is a community voluntarily created by various, autonomous Food Banks. Their common values and activities are supported and represented by a democratically elected Board. Food Banks associated in the Federation specialize in obtaining, transporting and distributing food products. Thanks to their large-scale daily operations, they obtain 50,000 tons of food annually, which is then distributed among over 1,600,000 most needy people through 3,500 aid organizations and social institutions. The food is obtained, among others, from producers, farmers, retail chains and as part of food collection campaigns. The organization also actively works to prevent food waste and promote healthy eating through educational activities addressed to various social groups, including social campaigns and workshops. Food wastage has many aspects. It can be considered as a social, ecological and economic problem. From a social perspective, a basic question is that many people do not have access to good quality food that would satisfy their health-related needs. Paradoxically, many people cannot afford to buy food while at the same time tons of whole food are discarded. However, food wastage has above all an adverse effect on the environment. Food production, processing and delivery to shops and homes of consumers entails water, energy and fuel consumption. Discarded food means wasted hectoliters of water and wasted energy used for its production, transport, storage and preparation. Food is wasted at every single stage of its production and distribution with consumers being responsible for over 50% of food wastage. Minimizing the scale of food waste requires actions to be taken to alert people about reasons and consequences of throwing food away.<br>Apart of main activity concentrated on collection and distribution of food, educational projects, research project and initiatives aimed at creation of national law supporting reducing of wasted food belong to our strategic goals. The above additional but also crucial goals are described in document presenting information about three main categories of our activity.<br><br>Federation of Polish Food Banks realizes its mission through:<br><br> -  Searching for sources of surplus of food,<br>  - Acquiring food, including products with a short shelf life,<br> - so-called non - commercial products, incorrectly packaged, whose nutritional value is beyond doubt<br>   - Storage of received products and their rational distribution to organizations, not individuals<br> - Promoting attitudes that counteract the utilization of food or food waste<br>- Large-scale initiatives having impact on modifications of national law aimed at reduction of food waste (National Act against waste of food, which came into force on 1th March 2020)',

We are working toward this objective by being agents of change, using dialogue to resolve problems, rather than violence. We address the various issues these children face by engaging them in fine arts, journalism, ballet, break dancing, photography and music lessons.  Through these activities their self-confidence, their pride and their hope for a better future grows incredibly.  They learn valuable life skills, such as perseverance, team co-operation and dignity. They know they can aspire to achieve more than the lives they see around them. We are also now an approved school offering free education from Pre-Primary to Grade 7, with Grade 8 being added in 2017 and Grade 9 in 2018, Grade 10 in 2019 and Grade 11 in 2020.',

We connect our members to each other through social programs such as Teen Empowerment Weekend, Family Camp Weekend, Adult Empowerment Weekend, Meet Your Neighbor Events, Summer Picnics, and Holiday Parties. We connect our members to the medical community through our Regional Education Conference, webinars, and ongoing efforts to develop a database of medical providers willing to treat adults with Spina Bifida. We connect our members to the broader community through referral to peer disability resources, advocating in each state for recognition by the Governor, and nationwide virtual programs such as Book Club and our Strut and Stroll Fashion Show.<br><br>Spina Bifida is the most common permanently disabling birth defect. It occurs when the spine and spinal cord do not<br>form properly within the first 30 days of pregnancy. There is no cure. Individuals with Spina Bifida have multiple medical<br>needs including: walking and mobility issues from paralysis; bowel and bladder incontinence; Hydrocephalus; latex<br>allergies and pressure sores; executive functioning deficits; and difficulty finding medical care as adults. Many<br>individuals have dozens of surgeries – orthopedic, urological and neurological – throughout their lifetime. Because of<br>this, they can encounter social/emotional and mental health issues in addition to physical limitations.  We endeavor to support, connect, and empower our members as they strive to live their best lives.',

All these culminate in chronic poverty, low income earnings and poor standards of living.<br>The above problems have not excluded the individuals in Kibwa Zone kampala, with a majority of children orphaned, and youth drop-outs unemployed so they are unable to meet the basic necessities of life, poor shelter, shortage of land and unable to access development information about the available social services. They have no minimum capital essentially for raising incomes and improving the quality of life.  So, these have over the years resorted to very low earning income/ economic activities, engaging in multiple relationships, others stay in redundancy resulting to idleness.<br>All these have led into disease spreading, family conflicts, drug abuse and many other associated problems.  Although there is some help from the Government and Non-governmental organizations and other development agencies, the result has remained. <br> PROJECT GOALS:<br> This is  a non governmental organisation established with aim of helping Vulnerable children, improving their economic and social welfare especially orphans and Aids Infected children to attain minimum basic necessities of life and standards of living.<br> To improve social welfare and economy of individuals within our organization especially single  orphans and youth <br>    Caring and supporting  children infected/affected by <br>  HIV/AIDS, war and domestic violence.<br><br> OBJECTIVES:<br>  Sensitizing the community towards an HIV free generation through <br>prevention of mother to child transmission.<br><br> People living with HIV/AIDS to adhering to drugs through timely taking, nutritional support and sanitation.<br><br> Starting up an orphanage centre for caring and supporting orphans/children who were infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, war and domestic violence because many of them are discriminated from families, schools and in their communities as well. <br><br> Providing holistic care and support to children until they grow to a level of basic sustainability.<br><br> Provide members with basic necessities such as food, clothing and shelter, and to sustain their house hold income.<br><br><br> Setting up a Kindergarten/Primary school for orphans.<br><br> Acquiring land and putting up permanent structures<br><br> To provide an option of better economic activities such as the idea of good farming and poultry.<br> To sensitize and mobilize over 300 orphans and disadvantaged children  in other income generating activities e.g. poultry, farming and other disadvantaged individuals to join the profit in caravan of and other profiting economic activities so that they can abandon the non-profiting businesses.<br>FINANCIAL SUPPORT:<br>Most of our members have got the ability run the project activities but they lack capital and bank loans would be an appropriate source of capital to finance our projects but they carry huge interest rates.  <br>We have also tried a hand of other several projects i.e. poultry, farming which we feel if expanded, could be a good source of income to our families and hence become self reliant<br> TARGET GROUPS:<br>The target groups e.g. Orphans   and disadvantaged children<br>      250                       50<br> METHODS/IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:<br><br> The primary method is that we have to put in place a workshop/seminar/meeting where our members will attend to sensitize people about our objectives.<br><br> That we have put in place an office to extend our services and get in touch easily to the communities.<br><br> We are also having a long run project of opening up a Nursery /primary  School and a large orphanage centre  for orphans, and school dropouts using the obtained funds.

      'Maison de la Gare\'s mission is to achieve integration of the begging talibe street children into formal schooling and productive participation in Senegalese society.<br><br>Tens of thousands of talibe children beg on the streets of Senegal for 6 to 10 hours each day for their food and for money to give the "teacher" or Marabout who controls them.  They live in unconscionable conditions in "daaras", without access to running water, rudimentary hygiene or nurture, often without shelter and subject to severe abuse.  Human Rights Watch published a widely distributed description of this situation in 2010, "Off the Backs of the Children".<br><br>Maison de la Gare is acting with the objective of ending talibe begging in Saint Louis, estimated to include over 7,000 boys between 3 and 19.  Having started in rented quarters in the former train station or "gare", a permanent center was built in 2010 with the financial and organizational support of international partners.  Programs at this Center will support the talibes of Saint Louis in obtaining a basic education or, for older talibes, learning marketable skills.<br><br>The begging talibe situation is complex, deeply imbedded in the cultural and religious traditions of Senegal and Muslim West Africa.  Although the United Nations\' Committee on the Rights of the Child has called for action in its 1995 and 2006 "Concluding Observations", decisive action is politically difficult.  Many initiatives have faltered by ignoring the cultural and societal realities of the situation.<br><br>Maison de la Gare is working from within the present situation to effect permanent change.  The organization\'s broad objectives are:<br><br>1. Integrate talibe children into the formal school system, through literacy classes and teaching the life skills necessary for success there.  This objective includes providing literacy classes, hygiene instruction and nutritional support (allowing children to attend class when they would normally be begging for their food).  It also requires documentation dossiers for individual children as necessary in the absence of any family support system.<br><br>2. Support talibes integrated into the school system with tutoring, nurturing and material support as necessary for success.  This requirement will grow as more talibe are integrated into formal schooling.<br><br>3. Prepare Saint Louis talibe children, from the base of Maison de la Gare\'s Center, for integration into society, and support the success in Maison de la Gare\'s programs, through sports and arts programs, medical care, and nutritional and hygiene teaching and support.  The talibes have in general NO access to medical treatment or support.  Maison de la Gare has recently built an infirmary within the Center, and engages a nurse and hopes to train nursing aids.  The Center\'s staff serves the medical needs of talibe children throughout Saint Louis, linking them to the Center and its programs and reinforcing relationships with the "Marabouts" who have control over them.<br><br>4. Prepare older talibes, age 15 and over, to be self supporting through apprenticeship programs, including tailoring and market gardening.  This requires in-depth relationships with the talibe students, finding ways to reintegrate them into society, either in their home communities or in Saint Louis.<br><br>5. Collaborate actively with local, national and international initiatives working to end talibe street begging.  Maison de la Gare\'s new Center has already made the Association a beacon for those concerned with a long term solution to the talibe problem, providing a base for establishing constructive working relationships with Marabouts around Saint Louis, the city administration, and with Amnesty International, Toscan, UNESCO and others acting for children on a national level.',

      "Mission: Hope Foundation for African Women (HFAW) is a nonpartisan not for profit national grassroots organization committed to women and girls empowerment, their sexual and reproductive health and human rights as well as elimination of gender disparities in all our communities. <br><br> We work for the empowerment of grassroots women and girls through income generating activities and education about their rights. We address gender inequalities through raising awareness, trainings, motivating, inspiring and mentoring the women and organizations we work with.<br><br> Our identity statement: We have firm believe in the power of ordinary people to change their situation and seek to unveil it<br><br>Guiding Principle: To promote gender equality and equity for all<br><br>Core Strategies: HFAW has adopted the strategies in addressing gender inequalities. We work with grassroots women and women's organizations to facilitate women's empowerment. We do this through various means: Engaging them in economic growth through individual and group projects<br> Providing skills to address sexual and  reproductive health knowledge and services<br>  Involving them in innovative strategies to total eradication of female genital mutilation (FGM)<br>  Supporting them to question gender based violence and use whatever formal or informal means available to them to end this vice in their community<br> We mentor women with self-advocacy skills and motivate them to be leaders in their families and communities<br> Educate women on their rights as guaranteed in the 2010 constitution<br> We build the capacity of women to promoters of health, safe environment and other rights<br>Our Core Values <br>-To fight against marginalization of individuals<br>-To be professional,  confidential and respectful <br>-Commitment to women's empowerment and seek respectful teamwork with individuals and groups and to uphold every person's human dignity and to do our work with utmost integrity, honesty, transparency and accountability<br>-We have passion, calm and logic in our work to eliminate gender disparities<br><br>Our History: HFAW was started in August 2011 by Dr. Grace B. Mose Okong'o and Mrs. Hellen Njoroge as a response to debates in our country that suggest that Kenya's women are not ready or willing to take up political leadership positions to fill the one third constitutional mandate. Currently only a few seats in the National Assembly are occupied by women, we have not met the 1/3 mandate. HFAW leaders see the problem as originating from our extreme patriarchal society which discriminates against women.  Advancing women's participation in leadership has to start with addressing the whole spectrum of inequalities at the grassroots. We must address economic and educational inequalities. Women have to be economically empowered and educated about their constitutional and women's human rights. HFAW leaders are engaging women in civic education, women's rights, violence against women, reproductive health and services, and total eradication of FGM.We have started with two marginalized communities of Kisii and Maasai where FGM practice is universal with nearly 97% girls undergoing it. This practice is so detrimental physically but also mentally as it socializes women to accept their poverty and low status position in their families, communities and nation.<br>The overall goal of this project is to improve economic and health of poor and vulnerable women,and advance human rights of Kenyan women and families through education, leadership training and the development of community health teams.<br><br>One of our current objective is to adopt popular education model as implemented by EPES Foundation in South America to train 30 health and human rights promoters to work in rural villages in Nyamira.<br><br>We will use the model to eradicate FGM in these communities; advance reproductive health, economic prosperity and human rights. Ultimately these women will lead much higher quality life and participate in their families and nation as full human beings.",

Our founding principles are based on the belief that communities need all citizens to be active and have a voice.  Equality and equity across gender is important and lacking in many communities across Mexico, especially in rural areas.  Leaders in communities need to have service to that community as a priority. We believe that everyone should have access to higher levels education despite barriers of poverty and location.  We believe that a nurturing, protective and faith-filled environment helps people grow and we encourage women to participate in the faith organization of their choice finding common ground between faith groups.   Our goal is to have more women to take on leadership roles in their communities and support them in fostering personal and economic development in their communities.  There are many government programs for marginalized communities here in Mexico, but the communities are not well enough organized to take advantage of these opportunities and community leaders more often than not use these opportunities to their own advantage either to political or personal.   If communities are better organized they can make better decisions for themselves.  The base of this organization is personal development for the community members.  Meeting the basic needs of community members is also vital to community growth, it is difficult to grow when all energy is focused on meeting basic needs of families.',

      "MISSION<br>To create a dynamic movement that promotes mental wellbeing and resilience in the Eastern Cape. We facilitate training, skills development and community driven support networks that unlock local resources and inspire innovation amongst learning partners. We further advocate for inclusion and rights protection of people with intellectual and psycho-social disabilities.<br><br>PRINCIPLES<br>PEMH has come a long way, emerging, as did many other traditional welfare organisations, from a model that served an exclusive minority within the population (in particular those from the White minority population) using a top down 'medical' approach aimed at 'correcting' what were seen as 'deviations' from the norm in society.<br><br>Today, PEMH has turned this model on its head. The following PEMH principles demonstrates this philosophy:<br><br>Our First Principle is Integration: it is both necessary and possible to integrate people with disabilities (PWD) into mainstream society and community contexts. About one in ten can be classified as living with disabilities: people who have been and often continue to be hidden in dark rooms, shamed, scorned and excluded by the rest of society. Our aim is to integrate into society PWD, in this case, those with intellectual disabilities in accordance with the most advanced international frameworks.<br><br>Our Second Principle is Recognition of Potential:  we make a key assumption that each and every individual has the potential to grow into the best that they can possibly be. As such, we do not judge or pigeon-hole people, thus limiting their inherent creativity and capacity to develop.<br><br>Our Third Principle is Outreach: PEMH strives to reach out to the most marginalised and disempowered sectors of our society by promoting mental wellbeing in communities that have the least access to opportunities and resources. <br><br>Our Fourth Principle is the Centrality of a Developmental Approach: whereby each beneficiary, his or her immediate family and community are placed at the centre of this development process. Welfare handouts or processes may have some place, but we try to minimise this, providing as we do the space for agency: for beneficiaries and communities to take the initiative, to lead, to take responsibility for their own development path. <br><br>Our Fifth Principle is Unlocking Assets: PEMH recognises that embedded in local communities is a wealth of - often hidden - assets, be these resilient community networks, valuable cultural practices and knowledge, practical skills and talents, as well as material resources. These assets are often hidden, or at least, not immediately apparent to those involved. PEMH strives to assist our beneficiaries to identify and unlock these assets, with a view to taking charge of their lives and destiny wherever possible. <br><br>Our Sixth Principle is Excellence: PEMH sees itself as a centre of excellence and innovation, capable of piloting exciting new paths and breaking down old barriers in the sector.",

      'The upraising problem with stray animals (dogs and cats) in Bulgaria actually exists for long years, but in the last few decades escalated significantly and caused social tension that endangers to confront people to animals in particularly unacceptable way. <br><br>The population of homeless dogs is generally a result of human neglect towards domestic animals - irresponsible breeding and abandonment. The lack of institutional and public control  was one of the main reasons for the situation. <br>The state and local authorities for many years have taken hesitant and inconsistent measures in governing the problem.<br>In the past years (the early 2000s) some outrageous, inhuman initiatives of the local municipal authorities led to mass slaughter of stray dogs. The "measures" have not demonstrated any stable results in solving the problem but caused huge negative response among both local and international animal friends community and media. <br>Following the Bulgarian entry in the European Union and the enactment of the present Animal Protection Law in 2008, the "Trap-Neuter-Release" method that has proven to be both effective and humane in many countries, was applied and nowadays brings expected results at controlling stray dogs population growth. <br><br>Alongside with this, local shelters (municipal and governed by NGOs) are overcrowded and for great number of already neutered and vaccinated dogs, the city streets are the only home available. Insecurity, malnutrition, health issues, human aggression and cruelty are the life-threatening companions of the homeless animals that rarely reach mature age. <br><br><br>The mission of the "Vzemi me vkushti" (Take me Home) Foundation is the life improvement of homeless dogs and cats. To achieve this aim, the campaign works in two main directions:<br>- To improve the attitudes towards the animals that live on the streets by convincing people that when treated with respect, these animals are safe for the society;<br>- To find home for as many actual homeless dogs and cats as possible by bringing out the understanding that those are adorable potential pets - affectionate, intelligent and successfully domesticated. <br><br>Supported by their friends and allies, the campaign team strives to change the attitudes towards the unwanted animals by bringing them out of anonymity and giving them a chance to find good and safe home. <br><br>The campaign shows cats and dogs available for adoption with their pictures and detailed information about their temper, habits and actual health condition.<br><br>The strict procedure for the adopters selection includes completed questionnaires, personal meetings with the candidates and final decision made together with the animal guardian (the person that provides temporary shelter and care, usually the one that saved it from the streets and that looks for lifelong home for it).<br><br>"Vzemi me vkushti" Foundation, encouraged by the successful record of its adoption initiative, has ambitious plans for the promotion of the cause for responsible and caring treatment towards the animals - homeless and domestic. <br><br>Vzemi me vkushti" Foundation seeks for donors and sponsors support for its projects - educational, informational, cultural, sports and entertainment initiatives that will spread the cause of animal welfare even more widely and will remind people the important role of the animals as loyal and loving friends.<br><br>"Vzemi me vkushti" Foundation follows a policy of financial transparency in accordance with its "Foundations Act" and "Rules and Regulations of the charity activities". <br>The Foundation cannot distribute profit. <br>The accumulated financial reserve can be used solely for the activities, stated in the "Foundations Act".',

      "Wright-Way Rescue has been a pioneer in the field of animal welfare for over 17 years when we began rescuing homeless animals from poor, rural areas and finding them loving forever homes. The problem of pet overpopulation in Rural America is dire and virtually undocumented, and we believe that helping these remote communities is critical to the national No-Kill movement. We work with over 100 rescue partners throughout the rural Midwest, South, and Southeast to save well over 5,000 lives every year on approximately 10% of the budget of similarly sized organizations. We are committed to stretching every donated “dollar” as far as it can go.<br><br>We drive over 100,000 miles every year to save the lives of homeless pets who are at risk of euthanasia, abandonment, or worse. Our robust transport program was once criticized by industry insiders but is now talked about as the future of rescue. We have always believed that More Is Possible, and we wholeheartedly agree with Orville Wright’s statement, “If we worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true really is true, then there would be little hope for advance.”<br><br>Wright-Way Rescue operates on a unique model to save lives. Animals come to our Admissions Center located in Southern Illinois where they receive complete medical care before travelling to our main adoption center in Chicago. Our program is founded on strong shelter medicine, and, to that end, we run a Critical Care Center near our Admissions Center that is designed to address highly contagious but treatable diseases such as parvovirus, distemper, and sarcoptic mange. We have a satellite adoption center located at Lambs Farm, a non-profit dedicated to helping adults with disabilities lead happy and productive lives. We also have a small adoption center at our Admissions Center, and we are in the process of developing foster programs in two other states. In addition, we engage thousands of volunteers every year as fosters, dog walkers, cat entertainers, and much needed shelter helpers.<br><br>To us, animal welfare is foundational to building compassionate communities, and that is our dream. Won't you join us?",

      'The "Verein fur krebskranke Kinderharz" (Association for children with cancer) is to become a central point of contact for affected parents or relatives of children with cancer in Germany.<br><br>When a child is diagnosed with a cancer, the diagnosis is probably the worst bad news that can be given to parents and relatives. The following time to live is hardly conceivable, the diagnosis of cancer is a task that seems hardly solvable. Life, as it was yesterday, is no more, it changes so much, seemingly almost everything! Many people are concerned only with the disease, which has been around for many centuries.<br><br>We, as an association, want to make this time a little easier until the children are rehabilitated, support the affected persons in administrative matters, provide advice in matters of schools, hospitals, clinics and self-help. In addition, we want to focus more on the issue of cancer in children, to help educate and support the research.<br><br>We want to help the children with donations, help them to make cancer research, promote typing measures, and support the children\'s clinics in our region, in order to participate in the small cancer patients there too, because the large centers in Halle, Braunschweig, Magdeburg, Gottingen and Hannover are already a bit away and some "small" examination or medication can then also be done on site and the way home is then more tolerable and for everybody more comfortable.<br>This great organization supports families with children with cancer. The latest project gives these families the opportunity to recharge their batteries.Located on a wonderful lake, this organization has restored vacation apartments. These apartments can then be used by families with special needs. Now additional land has to be bought to build more vacation homes on it. The price for this property is  25,000. Nearby there are also suitable medical facilities, which make a longer stay possible.',

This program is fully supported by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia (DWNP). Administratively, WILD is appointed by the partner organizations to administer and manage all MYCAT programs in compliance with Malaysian laws. <br><br>MYCAT began in 2003 as a platform between the partner NGO's for communication and collaboration with an emphasis on sharing information and resources and cooperation towards the common goal of saving Malayan tigers.<br><br>Through this platform, the Malaysian government developed the country's first National Tiger Conservation Action Plan in 2008. Among the more notable advocacy campaigns, were the incorporation of better wildlife laws in Malaysia, including Malaysia's Wildlife Conservation Act 2010 and the International Trade in Endangered Species Act 2008. MYCAT also advocated for a change in the legal status of the sambar deer, a key prey species for tigers, to a totally protected species.<br><br>In the subsequent decade, the platform initially created to close the communication gap between the NGOs and the government, has gradually evolved to engage members of the public for a greater stride towards the recovery of wild Malayan tigers. With the motto of Saving Tigers Together, the Citizen Action for Tiger (CAT) program includes Wildlife Crime Hotline, antipoaching surveillance patrols (known as CAT Walk), community ranger, community outreach and reforestation.",

      "MISSION OF CTD: The Development of Man<br> In October 1997, shortly after the death of the cruel Congolese military dictator Mobutu Sese Seki in September 1997, a group of young, idealistic professionals created an organization to use their combined talents for humanitarian purposes. Thus the non-profit, non-governmental, apolitical organization, Coordination technique pour le developpement, was formed. They were hopeful that a new government in Democratic Republic of Congo would foster opportunities for personal freedom and economic growth for the impoverished Congolese people. The first meeting included 5 agronomists, 1 doctor, 3 sociologists, 1 nurse, 1 veterinarian, 1 economist, and 2 rural development technicians. Within 3 weeks, CTD was established on Oct. 26, 1997, for \"The Development of Man.\" A ten member board was organized, including a president, vice-president (Jacques Mwinkeu), and 2 treasurers.<br> CTD was formally recognized by the City of Lubumbashi on Oct. 28, 1997. Unfortunately, the next national government in DRC was another dictatorship and provided no services for the people: no schools, no roads, no clean water, no sewers, no electricity, no sidewalks, no libraries, nothing to promote economic growth and personal freedom. Only taxation to support President Kabila and his army.<br> Amazingly this group of young professionals has continued to perform humanitarian work, fighting against poverty, for 20 years! CTD, also known as CPC, does not have staff and employees. The work is voluntary. Currently there are 5 agronomists, 2 rural development technicians, 2 women experts in genres and families, 1 woman nurse, and 1 woman economist. CTD/CPC's money comes from members' contributions, donations, bequeaths, international and humanitarian aid, and small income from work produced. The qualified technicians and agronomists provide training to villagers on cropping techniques, such as crop rotation, fallow land, use of chemical fertilizers, composting, and more. This NGO has great experience with the supervision of villagers, and they know very well those who are serious and credible. The poverty-stricken villagers do not contribute money to CTD, although they may be asked to repay some expenses as their incomes increase. CTD/CPC continues to work for \"The Development of Man.\"<br>________________________<br> In Aug. 2017, I (Janet Cook) was approached by Jacques Mwinkeu, an original CTD member, to find financing for a CTD micro-farming project. This project, Project to Support the Improvement of Corn Yield, is true to the 20 mission of CTD/CPC and typical of their work for \"The Development of Man.\" <br> Attracted by the opportunity to fight poverty in DRC, the self-sustainability of the project, and my personal knowledge of Jacques Mwinkeu's integrity, a friend agreed to finance this micro-farming project. Following is an overview of this particular CTD/CPC project for which we are in the process of obtaining funding, translated by Google and myself.  <br>Coordination technique pour le developpement <br>Email: Jacquesmwinkeu@gmail.com     ctdms2002@gmail.com  <br>Tel: 099 558 77 03     081 687 4625  <br>Office: No.350 114 Avenue Common Pin KANPEMBA  Province Haut Katanga DR CONGO <br> PROJECT TO SUPPORT THE IMPROVEMENT OF CORN YIELD  <br>1) PROJECT TITLE: Project to Support the Improvement of Corn Yield<br>2) RESPONSIBLE AGENCY: NGO / D Coordination Technology Development <br>3) Organization of execution: Technical Office of CPC/CTD <br>4) BODY FINANACEMNT: NGO <br>5) RADIUS OF ACTION: Valley Kafubu      <br> Villages: Chileuge, Kibulu, Mwenda, Kiponda, and Kamankanga <br>6) PROJECT COST: USD 32,000 <br>7) LOCAL CONTRIBUTION: USD 4750 <br>8) FUNDING REQUESTS: USD 26,500 <br>9) DURATION: 1 Year, then self-sustaining, expand to new villages  <br> 1. BODY AND HISTORY  <br>The nongovernmental organization, Coordination Technical Development, also known as CTD and CPC, was formed 20 years ago. CPC's seasoned agronomists work with peasant farmer organizations principally in field work (food crops and market garden) specifically to improve cultivation techniques through teaching in the field. <br>2. BACKGROUND AND ISSUES <br> Corn is the main cash crop for all farm households in the mining highlands near Lubumbashi. The successive falling performance each crop year in vegetable growing sectors made the need for a program to help peasant organizations apparent.<br> In the years, 1980 to 1992 farmers made good yields of over 5 tons of production in 1 hectare of corn. That good production was due to the granting of credit for fertilizer and a coaching staff from CMG Mining Company through its social development office. The repayment of this credit was in kind from the harvest. The system of granting loans (credit) in chemical fertilizers, followed by technical supervision by CMG raised the standard of living for farmers and social stability within the farmer's family. Unfortunately, since the fall of CMG Mining Company, the agricultural extension program has disappeared and consequently the social situation of farmers deteriorated because farmers were no longer able to pay the exorbitant price of fertilizer----which is currently $55 to $65 per 50 kg bag. Farmers manually plow and sow large areas, but without fertilizers, the harvest is very low. Current yields are only 800 kg/hectare. <br> Because of the soil (pH) in the mining highlands near Lubumbashi, the amount of chemical fertilizers needed to have a good corn crop production is 400 kg to 500 kg of fertilizer per hectare, (8 to 10 bags of 50 kg) plus 25 kg of hybrid seed/hectare. <br> The ngo CTD/CPC  with Organization Peasant Association is launching a cry of alarm to philanthropic organizations and people of good faith to help save lives of thousands of field working families. <br> This pilot project is to start with an area of 50 hectares at the rate of 1 hectare/agricultural household. 50 families will be the main beneficiaries during a year's cropping season. Each farm household cultivating 1 hectare will receive a loan of chemical fertilizers 400 kg (ie 8 bags of 50 kg equal to 4 bags of NPK and 4 urea bags) and 25 kg of hybrid maize seed. During harvesting, each family will receive 40 empty 50 kg bags to put 2000 kg of grain to pay at harvest. <br> In addition to fertilizer, seed, and empty bags, each beneficiary will receive technical supervision of CTD Agronomists. The Agronomist will be tasked to advise the farmer, beginning with the field measuring, plowing, and growing until harvest. <br> Individual fields are located in the 5 villages inside Kafubu Valley, in a 60km area to ease the mobility of Agronomists who regularly use the motor bike. <br> The distribution of inputs will be after the field visit by the CTD Agronomist accompanied by a member of the monitoring committee to be elected in each village. A contract listing supervision and repayment terms will be signed jointly by the CPC, the beneficiary farmer, and a member of the community monitoring committee.<br>3. TARGET GROUPS <br> Members of the Peasant Organization and other Farmers are the direct beneficiaries of agricultural inputs and technical supervision. <br>4. PROJECT OBJECTIVES <br> *To facilitate increased corn yield<br> *To contribute to food self-sufficiency  <br> *To fight against poverty  <br>5. PROJECT DESCRIPTION <br>The project is based on a loan of agricultural inputs consisting of 400 kg of chemical fertilizers, 200 kg urea, 25 kg of seed hybrid maize, 40 vacuum packing bags, and technical guidance. <br>The cost of this credit is: <br> 400 kg of fertilizer---8 bags of 50 kg x $ 55 = $ 440  <br> 40 vacuum packing bags of 50 kg x 0.37 = $ 15  <br> 25 kg of hybrid seed x $3 = $75  <br> Per diem for agronomists, fuel and lubricant motorcycle, transportation of fertilizer and corn=$95  <br>USD 440 + 15 + 75 + 95 = Usd $625 <br>5.1 Repayment<br>The grain corn price in the local market is Usd 0.32/kg so the credit granted Usd $625 gives a weight of 2,000 kg of maize grain to repay. Generally each farm household will have the duty to repay an amount of 2000kg of grain corn. After repayment of grain corn, the project will have a stock of 2,000kg x 50 (50 agricultural households) = 100.000kg corn grain to repay.  <br>5.2  Project location  <br>The project will be implemented in 5 sites (villages) in the valley Kafubu: Chilenge, Mwenda Kibulu, Kiponda and Kamakanga.  <br>5.3 Activities to conduct   <br>Acquire financing.  Acquire input supply. Enroll 50 farm households. Visit and measure fields of each beneficiary. Training and signing of agreement. Distribution of inputs. Monitoring fields. Harvest. Reimbursement. Corn storage.<br>5.4 Financing  <br>CTD's input=$4750usd             Funding requested=$26500usd  <br>6. PROFITABILITY OF PROJECT   <br>After repayment of 2000kg corn, each Agricole will have on average corn 3500kg grain remaining.  Each agricultural household will keep the family ration of 12 50kg bags of maize (600kg) for a 12 month supply. The 58 other bags (2900kg) will be held for sale or 2900kg x $0.32/ kg = $ 925 profit. The beneficiary will be able to buy own agricultural inputs for 1 Ha to grow maize for the next campaign. <br>The 100.000kg corn repayment by farmers will be sold by CTD/CPC at the local market price.  100.0000kg x 0.32 = $32,000usd.  In that amount of Usd $32,000, NGO / A CPC shall have the duty to recover the loan money granted to the project of Usd$4,750 and the difference is Usd  32,000 - Usd 4.750 = USD$27,750 will be to purchase of another batch of agricultural inputs for the new beneficiary (50 agricultural households)  for the next campaign.  <br> We note that the project may gain from the sale of corn grain a slight surplus ($27750-$26490) = $740usd. The use of this money will be decided by the committee either added to the beneficiary members or be used for any other purpose useful to the project. Of course, if corn price goes down, the project will have less surplus.<br>Lubumbashi on 14 July 2017. <br> Louise CHINISH KANAM",

      "At Food for Education, we believe that no child should learn while hungry. We are executing a radical plan to create Africa's first viable, sustainable path to feed the continent's 200 million public school children. Starting by feeding 1 million kids in Kenya, we are creating the blueprint for all 200 million children in Africa to receive a daily hot, nutritious, affordable meal. Our tech-driven model-designed by Africans for Africa-boosts markets by sourcing from local farmers, leverages economies of scale in production and distribution, and unlocks the potential of millions of children.<br><br>Hunger is one of the biggest-yet most solvable-challenges African children face. Despite Africa's economic growth, 90% of children on the continent don't benefit from a minimum acceptable diet, with lifelong effects on their well-being and development.Kenya, where 43% of the population is of primary school-age, is at risk of leaving its youngest learners behind because of a solvable issue: lack of food. Families consistently struggle to feed their children: over half of the population is food insecure and 1 in every 4 children under 5 is stunted, which hinders learning and children's future potential.<br><br>Hungry children do not have the strength, attention span, or interest to learn, posing serious consequences to their physical, socio-emotional, and cognitive development. These issues are exacerbated in urban and peri-urban communities, where inflation and high living costs make food one of Kenya's most urgent humanitarian needs. <br><br>The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated already dire food insecurity situations of many vulnerable Kenyans, particularly for women and girls. In Kenya, where year-on-year food inflation has increased by 27% means that some of the poorest families spend up to 58% of their income on food budget, pushing nutritious food out of reach for millions of Kenyan families. Further, the macroeconomic shocks induced by the Ukraine crisis has led to unavoidable increments in food costs, with food prices increasing by up to 70% over the past five months. Now, a Food for Education meal may be the only healthy, hot meal many children eat in a day. <br><br>Our objective is to tackle this vast, unmet need for food by leveraging the demonstrated effectiveness of school feeding programs as a critical and urgently needed social safety net. We provide hot, nutritious, subsidised school meals to some of the poorest children in Kenya: parents only pay $0.15/meal via mobile money and primary school students with our NFC smartwatches connected to a virtual wallet 'tap to eat' in under 5 seconds. We currently feed 50,000 children daily and we are on track to serve 100,000 children in urban and peri-urban communities by the end of June 2023. We utilise an innovative hub-and-spoke system where meals are prepared in central kitchens (hub) and distributed through systematised logistics to a network of schools (spoke). Further, by engaging contract farmers and using a centralised sourcing structure, we are able to lock in prices up to 30% lower than market prices for our core ingredients, thus bringing down our operational costs. By providing a balanced diet every school day to 50,000 children in public primary schools across Kenya, Food for Education is pioneering a solution to combat growing classroom hunger. With most of the children we serve coming from low-income households earning less than $2 a day, our program is their surety of food security.",

Every year we offer aid to over 200 people who want to learn independence despite disability. They want their dreams to come true and have a happy life.<br><br>In special training apartments, people after accidents learn how to live in wheelchairs. During sport activities, they improve fitness and motivation. They prepare for work during trainings because they do not want to live on public assistance. They develop artistic talents and even started their own theater. Assistants help children to do homework, and with adults they do shopping, cook together, learn to move around the city. Disabled children from all over Poland come to our Little Explorers Camp to learn independence.<br><br>We are happy to share our knowledge with other organizations. Specialists from all over Poland come to the Foundation to learn modern methods of therapy through art. We give parents of disabled children training in coping with the hardships of everyday life and help them to organize better, so they have also time for themselves. We meet with children and young people in schools to inform them about disabilities and teach them how to avoid accidents. Teachers from all over Poland use our lesson plans. We prepare volunteers to work with the disabled. We train officials and professional drivers, including those in public transport in Konin. Thanks to our audits more and more buildings are accessible to people with disabilities.',

The purpose of the Community is to contribute to the continual progression of girls and youth by providing opportunities for girls to be more empowered through their overall growth into adulthood with guidance and support, by aiding in their development of skills, education, leadership, awareness, social responsibility, career and fellowship necessary to create positive change, not only within themselves but within their families and wider communities.  <br><br>The overall services offered are capacity building, community development, mentorship, and advocacy.  Further to that, through our flagship programme, the Community utilises drama therapy and creative expression as a means to shift negative cognitive behaviour patterns that are evident in girls aged five (5) to eighteen (18), who may have been exposed to domestic abuse, sexual abuse and violence, in many forms.<br><br>I.

To encourage young "at risk" girls to participate in training programmes to develop leadership skills, which would encourage further service contribution to their community;<br>C. To promote the welfare of the community and its young citizens through the planning and execution of comprehensive projects geared mainly towards young "at risk" girls;<br>D. To establish and maintain stronger relations with like-minded youth lead and youth focused groups, NGOs, other organizations, and the furtherance of understanding about the challenges young "at risk" girls face; and,<br>E. To accumulate effective solutions that can be developed to influence the decision making process on areas which affect young "at risk" girls.<br><br>I Am A Girl addresses five (5) main themes:  <br>1.  Education; <br>2.  Motivation; <br>3.  Community Empowerment; <br>4.  Sustainable Growth; and,<br>5.

Always favoring gender equality and integration of different sexual options.<br> Vision: A world in which there is no inequality between the indigenous population and the rest of society. Where the native population is not considered as animals, pets or the disposable object of the fashion of the moment.<br> Mission: Empower indigenous communities by promoting the conservation of their culture, defending the right to land and the preservation of their natural resources, promoting sustainable economic development in gender equality and sexual orientation, favoring access to communication channels to leave the information isolation and giving them a voice before the institutions to demand their rights and denounce the abuses to which they are subjects of.<br> Our history: In 2014, investigating for a documentary, we made a stop in the mining area of Las Claritas. There we went to a brothel where a bingo was being held. The place was full of miners attentive to the draw, something that surprised us because bingo always seemed an activity for older people ... Until we saw the prize ... depending on the sexual orientation of the miner, the prize was a child or Indigenous girl no older than 10 years old, who waited to meet the owner of their destination inside a hole dug in the floor of the premises.<br>When you see something like this with your own eyes, it is impossible to remain indifferent to the problem. We realized that, in this market of basic instincts, we could do little to diminish the demand (the illegal miners come from many countries and for them the Indians are less than animals), but we could have some possibility of diminishing the offer if we helped the development of indigenous communities. And that's how the Fundacion Nativa was born.",

Such is products donated by food stores whose sell by date is that particular day, so we have only a few hours to deliver the products to the people who need them.<br>Our urgent food rescue scheme has been designed for these situations which means that food donations are transported from the retail stores directly by nearby partner organisations. The Food Bank in this scheme is responsible for building contacts, the adequate preparation of organisations involved, the launch of specific retail store projects and process monitoring primarily focusing on the constant control of shipping and distribution administration.<br>The donations include high value food such as fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy and bakery products that people are very happy to receive.<br><br>Non-profit wholesale <br>The main activity of the Hungarian Food Bank is to seek the edible food that can not be commercialized for some reason, then to organize the transportation, safe storage and distribution of the collected resources. Among the donated food there are aesthetically, e.g. packaging defective products, food products approaching their expiration date, post-season products and other products that are safe for human consumption but the manufacturer or dealer doesn't want to or can not sell it commercially for any reason. These foods often are destroyed. The Hungarian Food Bank's aim is to research the most of these kinds of reserves then to deliver to those in needs.<br><br>Food Bank doesn't offer direct donations to disadvantaged people, it distributes the collected surplus through charity organizations and governmental institutions which are in daily contact with the needy hereby the Hungarian Food Bank is a non-profit wholesaler\" creating a bridge between the organizations that help the needy and the companies possessing and donating food surplus.",

Unlike other initiatives, the goal is not to obtain funding for their own research, but rather to secure resources through patronage, sponsorship and micro-grants to support science research and outreach in Spain.  More than 200 internationally renowned scientists from different universities and research institutions support this initiative.<br><br>Apadrina la Ciencia (Sponsor Science) aims to direct people's solidarity to support research on issues related to health, the environment and new technologies, with special attention to basic research, which is the foundation of scientific progress and technological development.  Through job contracts and project grants, Apadrina la Ciencia (Sponsor Science) is a means by which citizen support can have an optimum return and maximum impact on the goal of strengthening the Spanish scientific system.<br><br>Scientific outreach is a priority of Apadrina la Ciencia (Sponsor Science), to inform citizens about scientific advances and help to generate critical opinion on important social issues.  One of the main objectives of Apadrina la Ciencia is thus to make science more accessible, especially to young people.<br><br>Apadrina la Ciencia (Sponsor Science) will be a platform for meetings, discussion and collaboration between scientists and society.  In addition, Apadrina la Ciencia hopes to involve all members of society, including institutions and companies, to help make our dream come true: to achieve strong, visible scientific research in Spain that generates knowledge and increases prosperity for society.",

      "Rachel House was registered in November 2006 as a charitable organization under the name of Yayasan Rumah Rachel in Indonesia with the purpose of providing palliative care to children from poor and needy families living with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer and HIV. <br><br>It is the first pediatric palliative care service in Indonesia, providing pain and symptom management for children in the final stages of their illness at free of charge. Without the service, many of these children from poor families would spend their last days in horrific pain without medical assistance.<br><br>Rachel House was founded in the hope that no child would ever have to die in pain, without love and care. It is built on the principle that \"we are not here to add days to the children's lives, but to add life to their remaining days\". <br><br>Its mission is to provide palliative care for children with life-threatening conditions allowing them to live their remaining days with joy and dignity in a non-discriminatory, safe and loving environment.<br><br>Rachel House's goals are:<br><br> To advocate and raise awareness of the need for palliative care in Indonesia<br> To assemble and train multi-disciplinary staff in pediatric palliative care<br> To train and develop home care teams to provide support and education to families to allow children with life-threatening conditions to be cared for at home<br> To reinforce local community's capacity to care for children in need through education<br> To partner other organisations that add value to our mission<br> To secure long-term financial sustainability <br><br>Being the first pediatric palliative care service in Indonesia where palliative care is not taught in medical schools, Rachel House's pioneering team of nurses were trained by palliative care professionals from neighboring countries such as Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. In every training opportunity, Rachel House has ensured the participation of medical professionals (doctors, nurses & pharmacists) from the large government-owned hospitals and public clinics, nursing schools and health volunteers and social workers in the hope of building the capacity in palliative care. <br><br>A significant outcome of this targeted training has been the establishment of the first pediatric palliative care unit in Indonesia at the Dharmais Cancer Hospital in late 2010. <br><br>In the 3 years since the first patient was admitted to Rachel House in December 2008, the service has reached more than 150 children in the final stages of cancer and HIV, providing them with pain and symptom management and empowered their caregivers with the essential education.",

This means helping kids develop and hone critical skills such as language, writing, digital literacy, etc., and ultimately increase confidence levels that can lead to new opportunities and choices in the future. Providing tutoring support, internship opportunities, as well as guidance on university/technical school options will offer children another critical layer of support as they start to make plans for their future. Developed skill sets, solid communication abilities, and a thorough understanding of their options will help set kids on the right path towards successful independence.<br><br>This is no easy task for any child, but it can prove especially challenging for kids without continual 1:1 attention.

We organize debates on hot international social topics with famous experts like Carl Wilkens for the USA, the only American who stayed in Rwanda during the genocide, Nagy el-Khouri from Lebanon,  Juan Grabois from Papal Counsel Justicia et Pax and many more. We cooperate with business to help to develop entrepreneurship among Africans.

Today, Darussafaka creates a better future for needy, talented students who have lost one or both parents. Inviting students at the age of nine, the Society provides full scholarship and boarding from a student\'s fourth year through to the end of high school. Given an opportunity for a world-class education, students are able to embark on a new life as self confident, thinking, inquiring, and curious individuals who feel responsible for the community.',

      "Overall women in Cambodia undergo a high number of abortions, and unplanned pregnancies are frequent. Many women die from unsafe abortions and those that continue with their pregnancy are often ostracised from their families and communities, and live in poverty. There are no social services existing within Cambodia to help these women. Many women in Cambodia come from extremely vulnerable situations, being that trafficking, sexual abuse, HIV and poverty are real issues today.<br><br>Mother's Heart vision is to provide unconditional love to women facing crisis pregnancies and to see women empowered with choices, so that they can make the best decision for their future and the future of their babies.<br><br>Vision and Mission<br><br>The vision & mission of Mother's Heart is quite simple but it drives the work that we do every day. Our aim is to:<br><br><br> Provide crisis pregnancy counseling in Cambodia<br><br> Empower women with choices<br><br> Support for every woman facing an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy<br><br><br>What Makes Mother's Heart Special?<br><br><br> We are the first crisis pregnancy counselling service in Cambodia <br><br> We love unconditionally and respect each person we serve <br><br> We respect and support a person's individual choice through giving them relevant, timely information <br><br> We don't discriminate or judge but serve all in need<br><br> We support (walk with) women and their families who face crisis pregnancies. <br><br>The Start<br><br>Mothers Heart was founded in 2010 by Katrina Gliddon and a small-dedicated team to respond to the lack of choice for women in Cambodia facing unplanned pregnancies. Research showed that abortion was a main form of contraception, sometimes resulting in maternal death. Cambodia did not have crisis pregnancy consulting services and there was no existing services providing women with viable alternatives to abortion.<br><br>Built on a solid foundation of 25 years of Mother's Choice in Hong Kong, Mother's Heart was born, adapted to the unique Cambodian challenges and culture. <br><br>What We Do<br><br>Pregnant Woman's Services<br><br>Mother's Heart believes that every young woman who faces crisis pregnancy has a right to know the options available to her. We offer non-judgmental support from social workers throughout the decision making process. We provide holistic and loving support for young pregnant women through their challenging decision, so they can make the best decision for their future and the future of their baby.<br>Counselling<br><br>Counselling is available for single pregnant girls and women, their boyfriends and families. Our on site counselling service includes guidance and support on making a plan for the baby, parenting and post abortion help. We support single girls and women when facing a crisis pregnancy, not only do we give them access to counselling; we also aim at helping them understand the choices ahead and the respective consequences. This process will enable them make critical decisions for themselves and their baby. Every single girl or woman in our program has a social worker and midwife assigned to their case, so they have on-going support every step of their journey.<br>Accomodation<br><br>Many women in our program are from poor and vulnerable backgrounds and require safe temporary housing during their pregnancies and postnatal period. We believe the best place for them is within their local community where their support networks have already been established. If they already have a small room we provide them with rental assistance and food allowance each month. Otherwise we provide them with a room, sometimes sharing with other young pregnant women within the local community. This helps women stay independent and to have some responsibility for their everyday living.<br><br>With special cases (teenage pregnancies, rape etc.) that require a safe secure place to stay, we have referral agencies that partner with us to provide temporary Hostel accommodation until a permanency plan has been establish for the client. <br>Health Care<br><br>Mother's Heart finances antenatal, delivery, postnatal, all medical needs of the client and baby. The staff accompanies each women to their appointments and advocate for the best possible care. We use already existing government health care centre. We firmly believe in capacity building by utilizing local existing government and community healthcare services already available here in Cambodia. Therefore, women will learn how to access health care for themselves and their babies in the future. Ongoing referrals.<br><br>Women also have access to health care for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV care for mother and baby, and contraception counselling and distribution. As part of our health care, all women have access to multivitamins during pregnancy and lactation, as over 75% of Cambodia population are micro nutrient deficient because of their diets. <br>Preparing for Birth<br><br>We offer antenatal training to the women we work with to help them prepare for the birth and the early days of parenthood. We also have on-going positive parenting training and child development training, so women can share their experiences and learn together. <br><br>Longer Term<br><br>Following the birth of a child it is important that foundations are established so that the women and their families can support the child in the future. Mother's Heart works with partners to support women to access appropriate vocational training and job opportunities. <br>Fostering & Adoption<br><br>We realise that for some girls and women keeping their child after the pregnancy is not an option. Every child deserves a family. According to the Government policies, Kinship care should be the first option then local adoption, permanent fostering, overseas adoption and the last resource being temporary orphanage placement until a family can be found. Mother's Heart works with specialist partner organisations and government services to provide foster care and adoption within the local community.<br>Advocating<br><br>Many of the girls and women that we work with have lost their voice with regard to what they deserve or how they should be treated. We advocate on their behalf for community care and better family support for every child. Very often the girls and women in our program need support and specialist care. We are able to work with many specialist partners that help the women access other services (legal, counselling for trafficking, rape, HIV, mental health). We have many wonderful partner agencies that work together with us to bring wholeness to each girl and woman in our program.<br>Education<br><br>We understand that unplanned pregnancies will always be a part of the world we live in, so we want to be more than just the solution to the problem. Mother's Heart seeks to educate communities around the issues of unplanned pregnancy.",

      "LÖSEV, The Foundation for Children with Leukemia is a non-governmental (NGO) and a not-for-profit public benefit organization that has been providing support for more than 65.000 children with leukemia and cancer, adult cancer patients and their families since 1998.<br><br>As 87 % of the families of the children diagnosed with leukemia who are registered to LÖSEV are from a low-income background and 11% have no income at all, LÖSEV provides complimentary treatment at LÖSANTE Hospital. Intensive treatment, accommodation and meals are completely free of charge for the patients and the accompanying mothers.<br><br>LÖSANTE now provides service not only for children with leukemia but also to adult cancer patients. Moreover, it is also a multidisciplinary hospital; providing medical services in other disciplines from cardiology to psychiatry.<br><br>Each year 200.000 people receive cancer diagnosis and every year a city full of people perish. Unfortunately, treatment centers are inadequate in the face of this increase and treatment success chance decrease. Due to this reason, we constructed Europe's most modern and well-equipped oncology city which serves in all branches from oncology to eye diseases, from cardiology to radiation all units. <br><br>Education Centers for Children with Leukemia help children compensate for missing school terms due to the intensive treatment. LÖSEV School has opened its doors in 2008, where 200 students receive education under the curriculum of the Ministry of National Education. <br><br>Accommodation and employment for families, who have to migrate to reach treatment facilities is a vital problem. LÖSEV has established a Village for Children with Leukemia to ease this pressure. <br><br>LÖSEV gives priority to provide social and permanent services in all its activities; thus, has been carrying out Vocational Training Courses for leukemia and cancer survivors as well as the mothers of children with leukemia. The aim of this project is to provide those compulsory migrant mothers with employment opportunities through, an eligibility certificate at craftsmanship as well as providing them with gateway and relaxation opportunity.<br><br>LÖSEV has become an NGO in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social council of the United Nations in the year 2007. Having granted vital equipment three times to LÖSANTE, The United Nations Women Guild has been a generous supporter of LÖSEV and its activities.<br><br>Meanwhile, our Founder Dr. Üstün Ezer was presented the World of Children Health Award. <br><br>We are also part of a global initiative and signatory of The World Cancer Research Declaration (WCRD) which aims to promote faster progress to defeat cancer by coordinating research among global partners and building on the worldwide investments in cancer research. <br><br>With the purpose to raise awareness to the increasing cases along with the prevention of cancer, another event pioneered by LÖSEV for the first time throughout the world is, The International Week for Children with Leukemia. This Week has been celebrated for the past 21 years on the last week of May.<br><br>The treatment of leukemia and cancer can only turn into success with the support of individuals, institutions and corporate partners from all around the world. We, as LÖSEV, believe that by sharing ideas, experiences and information, we can improve the lives of our children and provide then a healthy and therefore, better future.",

      'The ENLACE Cano Martin Pena Project (ENLACE Project) is an innovative initiative that pursues the environmental rehabilitation of the Cano Martin Pena (CMP), a highly polluted tidal channel in the heart of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the social, economic, and urban transformation of its surrounding communities through participatory democracy, community organizing, and intersectoral partnerships that guarantee residents a central role and empowerment.<br>Three institutions that work in close partnership were designed by seven communities adjacent to the Cano Martin Pena to facilitate the implementation of the ENLACE Project.<br>The Fideicomiso de la Tierra del Cano Martin Pena (Fideicomiso) is a community land trust that is a private, nonprofit organization with independent juridical personality that owns and manages the 200 acres of land, collectively owned by its members, for the benefit of all the residents of communities located along the Cano Martin Pena.   Its mission is to own and manage lands and other assets for the benefit of the residents of the Cano Martin Pena Special Planning District, in order to promote comprehensive and sustainable development, overcome poverty, and foster a healthy relationship between the urban environment, the city, and the communities. This instrument regularizes land tenure of approximately 1,500 families, preventing gentrification as an unintended consequence of the Cano Martin Pena ecosystem restoration project.<br>The Corporacion del Proyecto ENLACE del Cano Martin Pena (ENLACE) is a government corporation with a limited lifespan, created under PR Act 489-2004 to implement the ENLACE Cano Martin Pena Project, whose main contents are included in the Comprehensive Development and Land Use Plan for the Cano Martin Pena Special Planning District.  Through strong partnerships with private and public entities, and strong community participation in the decision making process, ENLACE implements projects and programs that transform Cano Martin Pena communities through socio economic development; improvements to their public space, infrastructure, and housing; as well as the environmental restoration of the Cano thorough its dredging.  <br>The G-8, Grupo de las Ocho Comunidades Aledanas al Cano Martin Pena, Inc. (G-8) is a community based non-profit organization that brings together 12 grassroots organizations from the Cano Martin Pena Special Planning District and the Cantera Peninsula as a strategy to unite with a common voice around the issues that are pertinent to all the neighborhoods along Martin Pena.  The G-8 is a critical and effective partner that ensures participation in the decision making process and implementation of the ENLACE Project.  Their mission is to promote the interests of the residents of each of the eight communities, and their assertive and effective participation in environmental restoration and community development processes, through programs, strategies, and activities aimed towards avoiding displacement, grassroots action, and comprehensive community development that improves the quality of life of the residents. The G-8 oversees the Fideicomiso and the ENLACE Project Corporation, and connects their work to the residents. The community leaders of G-8 do not make important decisions for the residents-instead, they create the conditions that allow the residents to decide and act themselves.',

      'ATZIN DESARROLLO COMUNITARIO<br>Tlamacazapa, Mexico<br>www.atzin.org<br><br>MISSION: Atzin is a non-profit humanitarian organization registered in Mexico, with a charitable sister association in Canada. Atzin assists rural people, particularly indigenous women, to attain better life opportunities, stronger cultural wellbeing, and greater self-sufficiency with more peaceful governance. <br><br>In 1997, Atzin was formed to counter this cycle of poverty and violence in Tlamacazapa. Atzin means "sacred water" in the local language, Nahuatl. Its humanitarian development programs emerged gradually in response to community needs and now focus on four integrated sectors: health and healing, income generation, education, and environment, water and sanitation.<br>PROGRAMS<br> Health and Healing Programs include a special needs program, a dental and oral health program, and supports local midwives in safe motherhood services. <br> Income Generation Programs provide technical support for small business development, such as a weavers\' cooperative, a sewing workshop, and a small store run by local women. <br> Community Education and Literacy Program integrates local responsibility with continuous learning. The programs include intensive training schools for young women, an open-air education program for out-of-school children; tutoring for those in school who require assistance; literacy classes for women and youth, and an early childhood stimulation program for children aged 1-5 years old.<br> Environment, Water and Sanitation Program introduces an ecological rocket stoves to families. For more than a decade constructed household dry toilets and rainwater harvest tanks, monitored water quality and investigated toxicity from multiple sources and its effects on people.<br>MISSION AND PHILOSOPHY<br> Through these programs, Atzin provides an external presence that is stimulating personal and social change in rhythm with the people of Tlamacazapa. Its goal is to assist villagers to reclaim their cultural identity and strength of personal worth. Working in Tlamacazapa over the past years, the Atzin team gradually pieced together a big puzzle of a complicated village situation. At the beginning, it was easy to see the living conditions of severe economic poverty. It took time, listening, many questions and a digging for data, to realize the critical environmental problems and importantly, the suffering caused by a collective poverty of spirit. A poverty of spirit means that people can\'t imagine that tomorrow will be any different than today or yesterday. The Nahuatl word, Tlamacazapa, translates as "people who are fearful" and is a cultural reflection of their history. The original inhabitants ran to escape the Spanish invaders more than 500 years ago, settling on a rocky, infertile mountain slope where they found water. An attitude of fearfulness has continued over the centuries, and now is coupled with other negative feelings of insecurity, victimization and rigidity. People tend to be distrustful, jealous of their neighbours and are not able to work together as a community. Hopelessness often prevails, with most impoverished families having little vision for a better future.<br> Bring enough resources to bear on a situation and environmental degradation and economic poverty can be solved if people can work together with a common purpose. But a poverty of spirit crushes this possibility from the start. That\'s why Atzin focuses on bringing people together to support one another. Whether it\'s a group of women sewing quilts, preparing food for the school breakfast program, or discussing problems faced by young families, Atzin\'s approach is people-centered. The task is to create opportunities on many fronts. Individuals learn to trust over time as they share and discuss, help each other, and seek solutions step by step together. Our annual ten day training retreat for young village women is a dramatic example of community building. The training is highly participatory as well as challenging, allowing the women to form friendships, greater insights and a sense of common-unity. This is vital foundational "glue." These women all carry program responsibilities as "promoters" and in turn, influence others in a positive rippling effect. <br> Let us consider the heart of the puzzle: a sense of empowerment always starts with a spark of possibility and grows from within. No one can actually empower someone else or hand them a richer spirit or life. The nurturing of that inner spark is the real work of development. Atzin is about people everywhere working together, patiently, energetically and lovingly, to re-humanize our world. It\'s about committed individuals making a world of difference.',

We do this primarily through performance, recording, commissioning and choral education. We believe that choral singing is truly at the heart of Britain's classical music tradition, and we are committed to showcasing its beauty, power and relevance to a modern and demographically varied audience.<br><br>Building on our success of the last six years, we are developing a new vision of cross-cultural work that we believe will introduce British choral singing to a wider audience than ever before, both nationally and internationally. We will be collaborating with, and commissioning, extraordinary artists from other world music traditions, building musical bridges between different cultures.<br><br>We are also continuing to expand our educational programme, which reaches out to under-privileged young people across the UK. We provide free mentoring and access to professional musicians and musical opportunities to aspiring composers from state schools. We were inspired to build this programme by the continual reduction of support for music education in our state education sector, and the knock-on effect this is having on young people's musical development and aspirations. <br><br>We have always supported the creation of new work, commissioning over 50 new musical pieces in the last six years, and with a target of 100 new works in 10 years. We have become known for our creative and prolific commissioning programme, providing employment and exposure to a huge number of composers, and building a legacy of early 21st century choral music which will continue to be performed for hundreds of years to come.",

We work with unsung heroes and influencers who are intentional about transforming systemic conditions to create generational change for the new economy. While you can donate your crypto to provide general support our effort, you can also choose to select one of the following social impact initiatives from our portfolio:<br><br>New Freedom Theatre: Cultural arts is crucial to preserving the voice and legacy of communities, and this effort aims to restore a historic African-American performing arts theatre in Philadelphia. Plays stream online and are performed in-person. Performances are written and produced by Karl "Dice Raw" Jenkins of the "Legendary ROOTS crew" who also serves as Chairman of the theatre. The current production, "Forgotten Founding Fathers," highlights the incredible contributions of black historic heroes in the founding of America. (https://freedomtheatre.org/)<br><br>Paragon Academy: An effort to turn the successful Paragon Project, a music and education after school program into a pioneering fine arts and entrepreneurship private high school primarily serving families of color. Paragon serves students who come from extreme family dynamics (mental trauma, addiction, homelessness) who make positive social change music. The students have made 4 albums and 80% have been accepted into college. The program was founded by Dr. Michael Anthony Anderson based upon his doctoral work at the University of Delaware and other sustainable enrichment models he developed in Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Sheffield, England (https://www.theparagonproject.org/).<br><br>For My Kidz: An underestimated inner city program capable of offering upwards 10,000+ community members mental health (therapy referral), academic enrichment, emergency service (housing for homeless), and workforce development programs. Founded by Jerel Wilson, a Baltimore native and local citizen-hero who has dedicated 15+ years of his life building trust in the heart of some of the most challenging communities in Baltimore, MD (https://www.formykidzbaltimore.org/).<br><br>XS Tennis Village: A sport for social good approach leveraging tennis and education to provide 3000+ underserved youth with a safe and positive pathway to college through a community-based academic enrichment program. Founded by elite tennis coach Kamau Murray (best known for coaching Sloan Stephens to US Open title in 2017), XS Village is likely the only black founded replicable tennis academy in the world, located on 30-acres in the heart of South Side of Chicago (https://www.xstennis.org/).',

      'The World Heart Beat Music Academy envisions a world where music bridges cultural, political, economic and linguistic barriers. We aim to inspire a passion for playing musical instruments and influence a generation of often alienated young people. We provide music tuition and personal development opportunities to over 260 children and young people between the ages of 5 and 24 years, who are based in Wandsworth and the surrounding London boroughs. Many of our students come from a range of challenging backgrounds. Some are the main carer for parents or siblings, some come from households with a history of drug addiction and alcohol abuse, some are classified as not in education, employment or training (NEET) and many are recent migrants and refugees, often moving into the UK without their parents or guardians. Many have difficulties engaging in school and finding employment when they are older. From our discussions with students, community leaders and teachers, we have learned that these young people are also less likely to engage with learning music and, therefore, unable to benefit from the social and personal development resulting from such activities. We provide students with tangible and useful experiences to develop their skills and build confidence, raise their aspirations and enable them to pursue whatever career they choose, in music or otherwise.',

We reach our achievements through combining a range of different tools and activities from free legal assistance and representation, through advocacy and communication, to research, empowerment and training activities. Most issues we work on are not addressed by any similar organisation in Hungary.

In a country with a billion plus population about 70% of  200 million children who are in elementary schools attend public schools. Reports have told us year on year about the massive learning deficit in the public schooling system. Some of the issues this system is plagued with are poor content,  teacher absenteeism, learning by rote and very poor teacher ratios.<br><br>The foundation uses the existing infrastructure of public schools mainly in remote rural areas. The children in the adopted schools are divided into levels/groups based on their English skills (and not according to age). The foundation has designed its own child friendly syllabi for each level and uses laptops and tablets (technologies these children have never been exposed to) and other fun filled teaching techniques to teach. <br><br>The foundation's strategy is to train and employ semi-educated rural women on a part time basis (this doesn't disturb the rural ethos) to teach in the adopted schools. These women whom we call coordinators are mainly homemakers and live in the rural communities where the adopted schools are.  <br>                       <br>Every adopted school has several children divided into three levels (Junior, Middle and Senior), a few coordinators to do the teaching and urban volunteers who take ownership of the school and mentor the coordinators and supervise the work being done in the school.<br><br>Children undergo baseline assessments at the beginning of the school year and then another assessment at the end of an academic year. We also assess a small number of children who attend the schools but are not in the foundation's School Adoption Program. Children who are in the program have consistently performed way better than the ones in the control group.",

    description:
      "The HeadStart Trust has been working in poor and marginalised communities of the Cape for over 10 years. In the last 5 years, activities centered around Napier in the Overberg, where the Jack family farm is located. Working at Protea Primary in Napier, we started with an organic vegetable garden development, warm beanies for the young learners in winter, donations of extra furniture and annual stationery and art equipment. We also arranged outreach programmes from privileged schools in Cape Town to do community service in Napier.<br><br>In 2018 The HeadStart Trust introduced a Music Education Programme. The results reflected international experience and research, and were astounding. Music pupils showed an average annual attendance rate increase from around 75% to 98%. Their general behaviour and academic results in other subjects also improved markedly. In 2020 we hired more staff and acquired more instruments and were able to increase those receiving music tuition from 36 to 130 pupils.<br><br>As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trustees of The HeadStart Trust have agreed to shift the short-term focus of the Trust to Food Relief.<br><br>There is a history of rural villages in the Cape Agulhas region being ostracised and disregarded, and when financial support isn't sucked completely away, these communities are often last in line. This underlines the massive challenge we face here: for a start, children don't have access to the usual daily school meals (only twice a week) and, in the past, local government bureaucracy has hampered efficient feeding schemes. The community is consequently wary of empty promises.<br><br>A majority of the community is not earning any income during the lockdown period and finding it very difficult to access the government relief grants promised by Pretoria due to consistently changing criteria and resulting confusion. Foreign nationals, who out of desperation sought refuge in these rural towns and send large portions of their piecemeal income to family members in other African states, are either unable or too terrified to register for any type of relief. The need for assistance is thus overwhelming.<br><br>We have begun our efforts by vastly expanding the Napier Primary organic vegetable garden and donating the required seed and tools for the village to contribute directly in their own medium-term food security.<br><br>But we require short-term, encompassing solutions as well. With the full support of Executive Mayor of the Cape Agulhas Municipality, Mr Paul Swart, and Napier's Ward Councillor, Mrs Evelyn Sauls, The HeadStart Trust will play a crucial coordinating role in helping to alleviate the growing social disaster catalysed by this pandemic and the lockdown. <br><br>We have begun lobbying civil society organisations, government funds and individuals to donate financially to a structured and inclusive Rural Food Relief Platform for Napier and surrounding areas. Furthermore, we will use our personnel and farm vehicles to collect and distribute donated food (under strict lockdown safety measures) to those most in crisis.<br><br>We will utilise the food storage and refrigeration facilities that have been established at the Thusong Centre and Packtown Food in Bredasdorp. Mr Swart has acknowledged that food collection and distribution is a new challenge for his administration and the municipality desperately needs cooperative partners to overcome the challenge we collectively face as a community.<br><br>The HeadStart Trust is also liaising directly with various community representatives and farmers. Communication is also continuous with religious leaders and on community social media platforms.<br><br>As agreed with elected representatives, we will channel food donation through the Napier Community Police Forum (CPF) and local farmer organisations. Local food donations can already be made at the Napier OK Minimark, but our intention is to expand this systematically and emphatically.<br><br>We need your help to support these communities that are a foundation for our own food security, but find themselves abandoned in this lockdown period.",

      'About the Clown Doktors<br><br>They are called Dr. Stracciatella, Dr. Furioso or Dr. Raclette and are experts in intensive laughing medicine. Together with their 33 other colleagues from DIE CLOWN DOKTOREN E.V., they bring joy and variety into everyday clinical life to sick children. By including the little patients in their jokes, they promote the healthy, playful side of the children, strengthen their self-healing powers and thus support medical therapy through the power of humor.<br><br>The special thing about it: The clown doctors are all freelance artists who have undergone special, long-term training for their sensitive task. Their humor visits, which are only financed through donations, always take place in close coordination with the medical nursing staff on site. True to the motto "Laughing helps heal", the clown doctors give their little patients a laugh test, transplant clown noses, prescribe soap bubble treatments or chocolate ice cream pizza. By including the little patients in their jokes, they support and promote the healthy, playful side of the children, strengthen their self-healing powers and thus support medical therapy through the power of humor.<br><br>In addition to the beneficial effects of laughter and humor, the regularity of the clown doctor visits is particularly important for sick and seriously ill children. Many children eagerly await "their" clown doctors. But they are not the only ones: The humor visits are also an important change for the parents during their stay in the children\'s clinic, which is often very worrisome.<br><br>Since 2009, the beneficial effects of laughter and humor have also benefited older people: the visits by the clown doctors have been extended to facilities for the elderly.<br>The warm welcome is always very touching. Singing, dancing, joking together or simply exchanging ideas about previous experiences repeatedly create indescribable moments for the residents - but also for the staff and the clown doctors themselves.<br><br>The association DIE CLOWN DOKTOREN E.V. has been organizing humorous visits to meanwhile 13 children\'s clinics, two intensive care facilities, twelve senior facilities, two geriatric wards and a children\'s hospice in the Rhine-Main area, in Central Hesse and in Rhineland-Palatinate since 1994. With more than 2,000 visits, the 33 clown doctors reach over 60,000 sick children and hundreds of seniors every year.',

      "Naisten Linja Suomessa ry (Women's Line in Finland) is an association registered in 1999, the purpose of which is to oppose attitudes and structures that perpetuate violence against women in society, to eliminate such violence at the social and individual level, and to help women and other participants in violence. In addition, the association strives to promote women's equality and rights in society.<br><br>Naisten Linja fulfills its purpose by supporting women and girls and their loved ones who have experienced and fear violence. The Women's Line helpline, chat service, online mail service, and peer support groups help anyone who defines themselves as a woman who wants to discuss a concern about violence. The contact person does not need to define herself in advance as an victim of violence, nor does she need to know about the different forms of violence. Mere worry is enough.<br><br>In addition to organizing services, Naisten Linja acts as a social influencer. The association makes statements, produces and disseminates information on violence against women, participates in public debate and cooperates with national and international actors in the field. Naisten Linja also provides support services for women who have experienced digital violence, organizes training on digital violence for various target groups, and carries out advocacy and research cooperation in the field of digital violence and online harrasment. <br><br>The main sponsor of Naisten Linja is the Finnish Funding Centre for Social Welfare and Health Organisations (STEA). In addition, Naisten Linja raises its own funds and organizes peer group activities supported by the City of Helsinki.<br><br>Naisten Linja is founded by those who have experienced violence. Peer support and the voice of the victim of violence remain at the heart of our work. The association exists because an early, low-threshold service package prevents and empowers women and girls who have experienced violence. Support for those experiencing violence as early as possible is vital, literally.",

      "Teen-Turn addresses the numbers of third level qualifications, particularly those related to STEM, attained by women from disadvantaged and underrepresented communities. Teen-Turn achieves this by providing--from when participants are teenagers--ongoing hands-on experiences, exposure to consistent, invested role model mentors and long-term support through alumnae career development opportunities.<br><br>*****<br><br>Teen-Turn aims to influence course decision-making processes, inform participants on education and career options, and combat stereotypes by strategically changing how girls from disadvantaged and underrepresented communities identify with STEM career environments through mentored summer work placements, after school activities and alumnae opportunities.<br><br>Programming begins with a work placement in the summer after Junior Cert, during which participants are exposed to projects, introduced to role models and begin to blog about their time so that we can evaluate the effect of the experiences. From there, the girls have the option to join after school activities which include science projects for BTYSE/SciFest, the creation of a social enterprise and app development for Technovation, homework/grinds clubs, or related events like learning camps and incubators with company partners. Once participants have completed secondary school, they enter into our alumnae network--which offers numerous events to meet with fellow Teen-Turn participants, mentors who are women working in STEM roles, and career advisors all there to help with qualification completion and to build a professional network.<br><br>What we do is empower our participants-to identify a STEM interest, to be supported in the pursuit of mastering skills and gaining qualifications related to that interest, and then provided the connections and social capital and ongoing reinforcement to develop a STEM career from that interest. We call it our 'Junior Cert to Job' commitment.<br><br>*****<br><br>Our proposition is that more girls acquiring in-demand STEM skills will result in more women employed in STEM careers, addressing skills shortage, gender ratio and social inclusion challenges. This is done by initially introducing STEM careers through work experience, followed by after school STEM activities including science projects and app development, then bolstered by STEM club involvement and ongoing STEM learning, exam support, discussion and debate events and career workshops.<br><br>NOTE: All activities, other than work placements, were successfully brought online during COVID-19 restrictions and can again if the need arises.<br><br>Core Project Elements<br><br>Summer Work Experience: girls in the summer after Junior Cert (aged 15) are introduced to STEM career environments at companies located near their homes; during this experience they are introduced to female role models, work on an actual project, learn to visualize themselves in a STEM workplace, and gain an understanding of the companies flourishing in their neighborhood thereby crossing what is often a corporate/community divide.<br><br>After School Activities:<br><br>(1) Project Squad, 13 weeks in autumn, participants learn about the scientific method, research methodology, experimentation, data collection, results reporting and visual presentations while mentored on projects of their own design by industry and academic women-in-STEM;<br><br>(2) Technovation, 13 weeks in spring, participants learn how to build a business plan and develop a mobile app that addresses a community problem, including design thinking, scrum/lean methodology, market research, pitch and demo presentations, and computer programming principles such as loops, conditionals, variables, and databases again while mentored on projects of their own design by industry and academic women-in-STEM.<br><br>Clubs:<br><br>(1) Grinds, year round, senior cycle and exam support is provided on a fortnightly basis by university students imparting techniques for studying and improving habits and following NCCA curriculum materials;<br><br>(2) Groundwork, year round, participants engage in ongoing person centered planning activities through monthly sessions conducted online by trained mentors who work with beneficiaries to develop plans that establish individual goals and what is needed in terms of support to achieve them with additional quarterly personal development workshops-this activity is particularly effective with those from our cohort who have disabilities.<br><br>Term Break Camps<br><br>(1) Incubators, during autumn and winter mid-term breaks, teams from our afterschool who produce work that could go into production/to market or, at the very least, be developed into a minimal viable product learn about and work on a strategy for commercializing their inventions or apps;<br><br>(2) Devising Week, during Easter break, 'devising' for participants means to plan or invent for a four day period when learning skills, mentoring and career experience are combined to deliver instruction in using technologies to problem solve in ways that are relevant to and currently being done in industry.<br><br>Alumnae Opportunities: girls who have completed secondary school can participate in offerings that are designed to be social and enable the building of support and professional networks including debate and discussion events, scholarship information and application workshops, CV, job hunt and interview training, study habits bootcamps, and \"give-back\" mentoring days.<br><br>Teen-Turn works with school representatives, including school completion officers and guidance counselors, to identify girls with promise who lack the confidence or are challenged by home circumstances, learning difficulties, or other obstacles (including ASD) that prevent them from performing in school as well as they potentially can. Conscious that these at-risk girls have high attrition and low post-secondary education progression rates, our approach is both immersive and followed up with reinforcement along what we call the 'Junior Cert to Job' route. An important component to this intervention is that each girl interacts regularly with women-in-STEM mentors as learning in the presence of female role models has been shown to impact girls' self-image and confidence, encouraging them to see themselves in new ways and stimulate new interests. We also provide recurring skill training and personal development opportunities.<br><br>*****<br><br>Teen-Turn seeks impact over impression, distinguishing itself by committing to support participants through multiple stages--secondary school, third level, and career--to combat the high drop-out rate which affects our beneficiary group. Teen-Turn focuses on long-term results through its 'Junior Cert to job' support system. We are on track to increase the number of disadvantaged girls entering third level/acquiring jobs by 1,000 by 2021 and expect to continue at a rate of at least 300 per year. Within five years we will have provided a significant number of disadvantaged girls in Ireland the social capital and skills experience necessary to acquire STEM qualifications and career opportunities. The impact is this development of a local talent pool of skilled women who can thrive in a STEM career environment from whom companies can hire. Resultant, too, is the knock on effect of their presence as role models to girls from their own communities.<br><br>Our Theory of Change envisages this impact as reaching even further than broadening inclusion in STEM. In addition to the likelihood of participants finding meaningful employment in STEM, changing their own and possibly their families' standard of living, there are other possibilities. Because of the enterprise programming to which the participants are exposed and the frequent feedback reiterating an interest in starting a business, some Teen-Turn beneficiaries will start their own companies, becoming employers themselves. The qualifications attained combined with the professional network developed should position these individuals to succeed. Also, as a factor of a skills shortage is staff turnover, employee retention will be improved by there being a talent pool from which to draw who has ties to the neighboring communities. Lastly, studies indicate that when those from disadvantage are empowered to become active citizens, they also become powerful self advocates. It is our expectation that future policy makers and community lobbyists will emerge from our cohort, already evident on a few of the girls' blogs.",

      "Mission<br>Appalled by the stark reality of 31 million orphans in India and shocked by the condition of institutions housing them, a few like- minded individuals got together to take serious action. This obsession was the seed which sprouted as Udayan Care, - which was registered in 1994, as a Public Charitable Trust.<br>While our first initiative was the Udayan Ghar programme for orphaned and abandoned children, we gradually worked towards ensuring higher education for girls through the Udayan Shalini Fellowship. In 2004, Udayan Care also initiated an Outreach programme for children affected by HIV, as well as the Udayan Information and Technology Centres to improve employability of under-served communities. We began with a thorough research on existing models for children in need of care & protection and opportunities that existed for young girls, women and disadvantaged youth. What our research threw up was an eye-opener and a driving force for us to develop innovative models across all our initiatives. Needless to say, the journey had many hurdles but it is Udayan Care's dynamism that has sustained it and enabled us to expand our intervention.<br><br>Our Vision:  Making Young Lives Shine<br><br>Our Mission: By engaging individuals, committed to human rights, under the framework of SDGs, Udayan Care enables nurturing homes for vulnerable children; empowers girls to aspire for and pursue higher education and gain employability; offers communities digital and vocational training to become self-reliant. Through research, training, conferences, and advocacy, Udayan Care influences policies and practices on the Standards of Alternative Care in the South Asian region.<br><br>Our Theory of Change -<br>India has about 20 million orphaned and abandoned children, who are denied their basic rights of growing up and developing in a family. Improving standards of care for such children in Alternative Care is a low priority in country planning. Gender discrimination prevents millions of girls from weaker sections of society to get an equal opportunity to continue their education, and technical, vocational and professional skills are lacking among disadvantaged communities to become economically self-reliant. <br><br>By engaging individuals committed to rights of the disadvantaged, Udayan Care is able to provide nurturing homes to children in need care and protection; empower girls to aspire and pursue higher education; offer communities digital and vocational training to become self-reliant; through research, training and creating platforms through conferences, it generates the discourse on the standard for Alternative Care in South Asia region.<br><br>Strategic Objectives in line with Mission and vision:<br>1. Provide protection and holistic growth to children in difficult circumstances.<br>2. Increase professional skills and employability of financially and socially disadvantaged communities.<br>3. Establish dynamic processes/models of Care and Protection.<br>4.  Influence Policy Reform and decision making processes.<br>5. Promote Voluntarism to engage in Child Care and Development processes<br>6. Work towards inculcating a new world view and practice towards children in vulnerable situations<br>7. Develop a structured research and documentation process that can be shared with other stakeholders at national and international levels.<br>8. Organize adequate resources for all the programs, maintain the financial health of the organization and ensure that we work effectively as well as be cost effective.<br> <br>Vision 2020:<br>1. Set up and sustain 21 Udayan Ghars to reach out to 400 children for long-term care and support.<br>2. Aftercare: Sustain and develop further a very effective Aftercare programme and 'continuum of Care' for our children and youth.<br>3.  Support 8500 Udayan Shalini Fellows in 19 chapters.<br>4. Develop and sustain 16 Information Technology and Skill Centres to enhance employability and knowledge under-served communities.<br>5. Acquire adequate number of Mentor Parents for Udayan Ghars and Mentors for Udayan Shalini Fellowships in keeping with expansion.<br>6. Involve more interns from prestigious universities and experienced corporate volunteers.<br>7. Set up a Resource Centre for training of Caregivers & roll out Advocacy Programmes on Child Rights, particularly for those in alternative care.<br>8. Promote the replication of Standard Operating Procedures derived from Udayan Care's best practices for sharing with other similar NGOs and for application across all Udayan Care programmes",

      "Education For All (EFA) believes that education a basic human right, and that educated girls educate the next generation. EFA focuses on girls from rural, remote areas of Morocco's High Atlas region who are missing out on secondary education due to living too far away from schools and being too poor to afford transport. <br><br>EFA was founded in 2007 to respond to the high levels of illiteracy (estimated at 70%) amongst girls in the most deprived and remote areas of the High Atlas Mountains in Morocco. Instead of going to school, girls were staying home, doing domestic chores, marrying young and remaining in the cycle of poverty with limited choices in life.<br><br>The 3 main obstacles for girls in rural Morocco to access school are<br><br> Their villages are too far away from the secondary schools<br> Their families are too poor to afford the travel costs<br> There is low awareness of and value for educating girls<br><br>THE SIMPLE SOLUTION<br>EFA builds and runs safe and well equipped girls' boarding houses. We currently accommodate 250 girls in 6 houses, from the ages of 12-18 yrs.<br><br>The EFA houses are a 'home away from home'. They are staffed by local women which helps to create an environment where their culture is respected and trust is built with the local community. They have 3 nutritious meals a day, hot showers, computer rooms and plenty of books and learning support. We also run an international volunteer programme to support the girls in their studies and activities which broaden their horizons.<br><br>EFA Short Film<br>Register to watch the short Film: https://efamorocco.org/videos/changing-worlds/<br>Watch the trailer: https://vimeo.com/355137701<br><br>It only costs $3 a day to educate a girl for a whole year! OR $85 per month or $1000 per year.<br><br>IMPACT<br>The short-term impact of EFA's work is that many girls now have the opportunity to go to school who otherwise would be at home. Since 2007 we have given access to a full secondary education for 370 girls. These girls are now young women want to become lawyers, scientists, teachers and entrepreneurs! We now have over 130 girls enrolled at University since 2013, with two now studying their Master's Degrees, 3 on full university scholarships and one who just graduated to become a Biology teacher.<br><br>The longer-term impact is that these young women will be able to become financially independent, contribute to the workforce and economy and have more choice and voice in their families and society, ensuring progressive equality for future generations.<br><br>They have also inspired a positive shift in attitudes in their communities towards educating girls, and are strong role models to their sisters and friends, demonstrating what is possible for them and how to realise their potential through education.",

Our charity helps orphanages cover their needs in the absence of proper state funding because children living in specialized institutions should not be the forgotten victims of this war. We are determined to aid children's hospitals with medical tools, supplies, and the medical equipment necessary to afford children the healthcare they need. Our team members are also coordinating efforts to support mothers of children with disabilities in starting a new venture to earn an income and provide for their children in war circumstances. This war affects everyone. We believe no child should be left behind. Thank you for standing with Ukraine. Every life matters, your help counts.",

We return to each family farm  once a year and prescribed times, we allow the family to harvest some lumber through the thinning process.  The family can collect all  fruits.  Our plantings are highly diverse native species.  We also engage in regular education porgrams around Costa Rica and the globe through building networks fo special tree friends. Our Mission is to create win win win relationships among people who want to offset their carbon footprint and thereby share their resources with those struggling to live with the remaining rainforest on their land. Giving local people alternative income streams long term by planting valuable lumber within each project teaches and empowers locals to plant trees for cutting instead of illegally cutting the rainforest. Planting trees in high diversity insures protection of flora andf fauna and watersheds.',

    description:
      "The Ombetja Yehinga Organisation(OYO) is a Namibian Trust (T109/09) that uses the Arts to create social awareness. All our projects have an Art component (dance, drama, films, publications), all address a social issue (including HIV, teenage pregnancy, gender-based violence, anti-bullying). Most of our projects are in school but we also work with offenders in correctional facilities.<br><br>OYO believes that children and teenagers need to be reached more than once (to reinforce messages), using exciting mediums (to stimulate their attention) with simple, yet strong messages (to impact on their attitudes and behaviours). OYO suggests interventions to start a dialogue with the schools (whereby schools are recipient of an activity), followed by interventions at school level (under the form of a campaign where schools have to take a stand and become actively involved in the process). OYO believes that children and teenagers have the answer. All we need is to unlock their creativity. <br><br>Among others, OYO has:<br> Created the OYO dance troupe. This is the first and currently only troupe in Namibia employing dancers as performers. The troupe has reached over 200,000 children in schools so far, performing a vast repertoire. <br> Produced various DVDs. Most DVDs are used in schools during evening sessions with learners, triggering discussion and challenging norms. 'Salute' is the first DVD produced in Namibian Correctional Facilities with inmates, telling their stories. Other DVDs include 'Kukuri' on child marriage, 'pap and milk' on sugar daddies (inter-generational sex) and the mini-series 'my best interest' on children's rights.<br> OYO has worked with numerous out-of-school youth groups in many parts of the country, produced various drama and photographic exhibititons (including 'the caring Namibian man' and 'still life') and supported various school clubs and girls' camps. <br><br>OYO uses the Arts because the Arts don't appeal to your intellect but to your feelings. It makes you feel and once you feel, you start reflecting. Programs appealing to your intellect provide you with knowledge, but the Arts, appealing to your feelings, impact your choices and subsequently influence your attitude and behavior. <br><br>Some of our projects include: <br> The San matter project: The rationale for San Matter Phase I was that only 67 percent of San children in the country enroll in school. And only 1 percent of those children complete secondary school. (OSISA Group report \"Rethinking Indigenous Education,\"). One of the reasons for the high drop out of San children from the education sector is linked to cultural bullying in schools. Since 2016 OYO implements an anti-cultural bullying project in twenty four schools across two regions of Namibia. Activities include intervention by the OYO dance troupe, training of the local out-of-school youth group, implementation of San girls camps, organisation of the San School friendly competition once every second year. Over 88% of the San children involved in the project have re-enrolled in schools in 2019. <br> The growing strong in the Karas region: Since 2006, OYO has been supporting various youth groups, training them in the arts of drama, dance and songs and creating shows of social significance with them. In 2008, OYO established its OYO dance troupe. OYO is now developing packages involving both the dance troupe and youth groups working on the same issue from two different angles and visiting the same schools to reinforce messages. <br> The 'In and out' project: this is project to work with inmates (called offenders in Namibia) in correctional facilities on issues around HIV and Sexual and Reproductive Health. In a country where sodomy is still criminalised, offenders do not have access to condoms. Together with offenders OYO works towards addressing their needs, wants and fears and encourages them to know their status. Over 600 inmates have been tested as part of the project. <br><br>\"OYO's application of the performing and visual arts in a highly participatory and learner centred pedagogy represents a model of excellence and best practice.\" <br>Hon. Nangola Mbumba MP, then Minister for Education, September 2009 (now Vice President of the Republic of Namibia)",

      'Kardias was founded in 2000 with the concern to improve the quality of comprehensive care of children with congenital heart disease, led by Dr. Alexis Palacios Macedo, Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgeon. <br><br>Dr. Palacios Macedo had trained as a Fellow of Dr. Charles Fraser in Texas Children\'s Hospital, and wanted to replicate the best practices he learned back to Mexico. <br><br>He started as chief of surgeon in the Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery Program of the National Institute of Pediatrics (INP). Here he became keenly aware of all the needs that the hospital needed in order to improve the reach and outcomes. <br><br>This is when Kardias was born, to help fundraise to fill the gap between what was available and what we needed to try and replicate best practices around the world. <br><br>Understanding the concept of a dedicated team, the same group of specialized doctors working together all the time, was a mayor and disruptive innovation that Dr. Palacios Macedo started to replicate. <br><br>Along the same line the need for a cardiovascular intensive care unit, against the concept of a pediatric intensive care unit, was also a mayor accomplishment. <br><br>In 2003, in collaboration with the "Heart Center" of Texas Children\'s Hospital (TCH) began the Training and Development Program to health professionals of the division of Cardiovascular Surgery of the INP.<br><br>Over the years, the cardiovascular division of the INP has been strengthened with infrastructure and training. In 2009, the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (UCICV) of this institute was inaugurated, significantly improving the care of patients with congenital heart disease who undergo surgery.<br><br>However the program hit a wall in terms of improvement in outcomes in mortality rates, because of the limitations and bureocracy in INP. <br><br>Because of this we designed an innovative program with the best Mexican private hospital, ABC. In Mexico it is very difficult, and not common to have a high speciality division in a private hospital, because the volume of patients can be found only in public sector. It is estimated that only 5%-7% of population has private insurance. <br><br>This is where Kardias contributes,  channel and pay for patients from a vulnerable population, in the private hospital. The benefits of this collaboration are twofold. Offering patients from without resources the best posible care they can receive. And allowing the ABC hospital have a Heart Center, so  that in Mexico we can offer the best care available with world wide standards.  <br><br>The collaboration agreement with the ABC Medical Center, in 2012, it initiated a pediatric cardiovascular surgery program to care for vulnerable patients from the INP and the government hospitals of Mexico City.<br><br>Today, Kardias has performed a total of 2,789 surgeries, of which 396 were carried out in the ABC and 2,393 in the INP.',

      "The mission of the Fundacion Helping Hands-La Paz (Bolivia) is to open up educational opportunities for marginalized and vulnerable Bolivian youth of scarce economic resources so that they may complete a programme of studies to become technicians or university graduates.   Education is the focus of the Fundacion Helping Hands -La Paz (Bolivia),  and we hope to broaden the horizons of our young people by providing new experiences and activities.  Helping Hands works with several orphanages, social projects and international organizations to give these young people the opportunity to educate themselves and become more productive and responsible citizens.  In particular we work with girls who, traditionally, have been marginalized as far as upper education is concerned. <br>Our project began in an informal way in 2004 to give support to the 48 boys who had to leave the state boys' home at the age of 18 and they had not yet finished high school.   We provided rent support, school materials, moral support and help with documentation so that the boys could finish high school.  The project grew to include studies in technical schools and universities when the boys had finished high school and in 2006 we expanded to include girls from the many social projects in La Paz and El Alto.  In 2014 our project was formalized with the creation of the Fundacion Helping Hands - La Paz (Bolivia) and we now support 100 students from the ages of 15 to 25 of which 65% were girls in 2017.<br>The Fundacion Helping Hands-La Paz (Bolivia) also provides medical and dental care for the students to insure their permanency in their programmes of study.   There is no universal health care in Bolivia, and the costs of health care can be devastating for those lacking economic resources.  <br>Students are required to attend monthly meetings where we provide talks on many themes of interest to young people in order to provide a more integral personal development.   We invite speakers in the areas of education in reproductive health, the environment,   values, general health, living without violence, and written expression.   We organize outings to museums and other cultural activities. <br>We feel that in order for an underdeveloped country to progress it must provide education for all of its citizens.   Education is one of the keys to eradicating poverty.",

In order to advocate for children's rights and raise awareness of child welfare issues, we work on improving legislation, coordinating a network of related child welfare agencies and organizations, as well as monitoring the government's child welfare system and policies, so as to create a better environment for our children.<br><br>Our History,<br>In 1990, the Child Welfare League Committee was organized to facilitate the 1990 amendment of the 1973 Child Welfare Law. The committee was comprised of a group of enthusiastic professionals including legislators, lawyers, social workers as well as other concerned participants. The Committee prepared a Revision of the Child Welfare Law which was then sent to the Legislative Yuan for approval. The Committee believed there was a need for a permanent organization to carry on the child welfare work in Taiwan and thus the Child Welfare League Foundation (CWLF) was established in December 1991.<br><br>Since then, CWLF has provided a wide range of publicly accessible services related to child welfare. CWLF works to resolve social problems through public education, social services, and legislative change while addressing new problems as needs arise.<br><br>CWLF was first established in Taipei in 1991. The Kaohsiung branch was later established in December 1997, followed by the Taichung branch in 1998. CWLF in collaboration with the Taiwan Provincial Government also founded the Missing Children Data Resource Center in Taichung.<br><br>Goal,<br>To facilitate the amendment of child welfare laws and policies<br>To promote the concepts of child welfare<br>To provide child welfare services<br>To conduct child welfare research<br>To build child welfare networks<br>To establish a child welfare data center",

Lasting between ten and twelve years, the longest of any similar initiative in the Bay Area, this investment in our students bears a huge dividend for them, their families and society as a whole: a confident college graduate, prepared for the kind of career in modern America that can lift an entire family out of poverty in a single generation.',

      'Coalition for Rainforest Nations (CfRN) envisions a world where rainforests are fairly valued for their ecosystem services. Simply put, we strive to make trees worth more alive than dead. Founded in 2005, CfRN initially consisted of two countries - Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica - which introduced the REDD+ framework (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) to the UN at the annual COP climate summit. It took 10 years for CfRN to get REDD+ adopted by the UN as part of the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and during that time, CfRN grew from 2 countries to over 50. The UN REDD+ framework that CfRN championed has achieved over 11 gigatons of verified carbon emissions over time; this is greater than the combined annual emissions of the United States and European Union! But we have much more work ahead to truly end and reverse global deforestation. Today, CfRN has 3 programs: Policy (supporting and coordinating rainforest countries at COP and other climate negotiations), Capacity Building (training rainforest countries to implement the technical requirements of REDD+) and Direct Finance (tools to raise more funding for rainforest countries to adopt conservation practices). CfRN is a small nonprofit that has achieved big results. With a staff of just 15 and consistent leadership from founders Kevin Conrad and Federica Bietta, CfRN managed to develop and implement a forest conservation mechanism that has achieved major emission reductions with more to come.',

Circle of Care continues to stand with these families in treatment, providing a unique set of programs and services that supply immediate and needed support at every step of these families’ journeys. <br><br>While many cancer organizations offer episodic assistance, like a summer away at camp or a day trip, Circle of Care is a constant source of support. They are the only pediatric cancer organization in Connecticut that has services to last through, and beyond, a child’s cancer treatment. They are also the only pediatric cancer organization in Connecticut that offers financial assistance and other services to young adults, up to age 26. This extensive reach fills a critical service gap in the state.',

Each music set is chosen from eclectic traditions, including rock, folk, gospel, and hymns. Some people may physically express their praise through raised hands, movement, and loud singing and shouts others are still and quiet. In this time of response, people often discover God responds back. Some feel a sense of joy or peace, others cry, and some feel God grabbing their attention about something brought up in the service. You may find yourself worshipping in one style one week and another the next. The same might be true for how God responds to you. This diversity is reflective of our pursuit of a living and dynamic God.',

From our success, the Humane Society of Boulder Valley has earned a reputation for forward looking leadership and frequently works with other companion animal care facilities through mentoring and animal relocation.',

GCE supports local people by helping them develop sustainable livelihoods and activities as they manage their own community forests and in so doing improve their lives.  <br><br>Since its founding in 2012, GCE has helped conserve 1.2 million acres of forest in Équateur Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has installed 17 wells that serve 34,000 people. This work is incredibly important not only to the people living there but to all of us globally, because we depend on the Congo Basin rainforest (the Earth’s 2nd largest) in the face of climate change.  This area is also home to the only surviving bonobos and other endangered species, including forest elephants.<br><br>GCE’s small team does a great deal with very few resources and is trusted by the people they serve in the DRC.

      'On October 1, 1891, Stanford University opened its doors after six years of planning and building. In the early morning hours, construction workers were still preparing the Inner Quadrangle for the opening ceremonies. The great arch at the western end had been backed with panels of red and white cloth to form an alcove where the dignitaries would sit. Behind the stage was a life-size portrait of Leland Stanford, Jr., in whose memory the university was founded.  About 2,000 seats, many of them sturdy classroom chairs, were set up in the 3-acre Quad, and they soon proved insufficient for the growing crowd. By midmorning, people were streaming across the brown fields on foot. Riding horses, carriages and farm wagons were hitched to every fence and at half past ten the special train from San Francisco came puffing almost to the university buildings on the temporary spur that had been used during construction.  Just before 11 a.m., Leland and Jane Stanford mounted to the stage. As Mr. Stanford unfolded his manuscript and laid it on the large Bible that was open on the stand, Mrs. Stanford linked her left arm in his right and held her parasol to shelter him from the rays of the midday sun. He began in measured phrases:   "In the few remarks I am about to make, I speak for Mrs. Stanford, as well as myself, for she has been my active and sympathetic coadjutor and is co-grantor with me in the endowment and establishment of this University..." What manner of people were this man and this woman, who had the intelligence, the means, the faith and the daring to plan a major university in Pacific soil, far from the nation\'s center of culture ? a university that broke from the classical tradition of higher learning?',

      "OMA's vision is of a society where everyone has access to healthy, nutritious, and affordable food, while benefiting from the positive impact on physical health, well-being and social connectivity that this brings. <br><br>OMA's mission<br><br>OMA's mission is to embed the belief throughout our city that access to healthy, nutritious and affordable food is a basic human right. While inequalities in accessing food persist, and while food vulnerability affects people in our communities, we seek to redress this imbalance by delivering free, healthy food and re-heatable meals to people experiencing deprivation and food poverty in our city. <br><br>Our mission is mutual aid, not charity. All our food services are delivered with dignity and in solidarity.<br><br>OMA's Mission in Focus: <br><br>Oxford Mutual Aid is a community organisation which works to support our peers and neighbours in Oxford, primarily through the provision of food support. Founded to respond to the challenges of the pandemic, we have since become a vital part of Oxford's aid infrastructure. We are the only local service that is active seven days a week, operates on a delivery basis, and supplies baby necessities.<br><br>We believe that nobody should face food insecurity, or experience stigma for seeking assistance. We do not implement means testing as it is invasive, expensive, and discourages people from seeking help. We provide regular food, baby and other essential supplies parcel support to more than 2,000 people in 834 households across Oxford (over 1% of the non-student population) and have delivered over 20,000 food parcels to date. <br><br>We believe in supporting physical, mental, and emotional health. For this reason we offer nutritious and inviting food parcels that match the preferences, health requirements, and ethical/religious needs of each individual. Where people don't have the facilities or capacity to cook, we offer volunteer-prepared meals. Our Kitchen Collective programme has to date provided over 30,000 meals to the community, which, as well as providing nutritious meals to those with minimal cooking facilities, has been vital in bringing together organisations from across the city, including colleges, universities and local groups. <br>Collaboration has always been at the heart of what we do. This is centered upon building systems that source and supply nutritious food to those who need it, reduce food waste and, and support local businesses. Through local supply networks, we can increase the food/supply resilience of our community in a time of uncertainty.<br>We believe in solidarity. Our volunteers come from within the community that we serve. Many of us receive food support from Oxford Mutual Aid, giving us invaluable insight into how our processes work on every level. We aim to ensure that volunteers and recipients are empowered to see their positive impact in the community, harnessing their abilities in ways that recognise the value of diverse experiences, while being mindful of different capacities. We try to ensure that the people delivering parcels to each individual remain the same week by week, so that they can develop a rapport. We also contact each of our regular recipients of support each week, with the aim of creating a network that connects our users to each other and their community, reducing the risk of social isolation and the negative health outcomes that it causes.   <br>We believe in community. This foundational value is why we wish to establish an intergenerational lunch club, enabling members of the community to socialise with each other where they otherwise would not have the opportunity.",

WTAR rescues animals primarily from Mississippi, where young animals are euthanized by the hundreds each and every day due to overpopulation. Lack of spay-neuter laws and large sections of rural land allow for free-roaming animals to reproduce, leading to a surplus of neglected, homeless, and starving puppies and kittens. These animals are then found and brought to local animal shelters, which simply cannot provide the care or homes these pets need in order to survive. Ultimately, they get euthanized for space or for illnesses contracted at the shelter.<br><br><br><br>WTAR rescues these pets by operating a life-saving transport, foster, and adoption program in Northern Virginia. WTAR finds the pets who need us the most by employing a full-time transport coordinator on the ground in Mississippi (WTAR South), with the goal of working directly with these shelters and communities to be a resource before they euthanize for space. Rescued animals are then scheduled and placed on emergency transport with WTAR to Northern Virginia. These transports operate weekly, relieving the shelters and communities from overcrowding and needless euthanasia.  Upon arrival, they undergo an extensive veterinary intake evaluation and then are placed in foster homes until find their forever homes through private Meet & Greets.',

As an animal advocate, she had no idea how dire the situation was but was struck by the idea that raising global funds through micro financing to support the people and organizations she had met while researching in Africa could be of great service.  What makes us unique is that we then film the funds we donate to each project and create mini-documentaries for you, our Over and Above Family.  We feel this is something that empowers our donors and members to share with friends and family to further the message that these animals and communities need our help.<br><br>Over and Above Africa’s team share a mutual vision that many of the challenges these animals face can be addressed with a global community's awareness and involvement",

We embrace the mindset of experimenting in public, operating transparently, and pivoting when necessary. As a result, the ICA SF may always in a sense be “under construction.”\n<br> <br>\n\nThrough exhibitions, programs, performances, and social opportunities, the ICA SF seeks to broaden the possibilities for civic and creative engagement within the Bay Area’s museum ecosystem and to enable artists to push boundaries, experiment with new ideas, and take risks—just as we have and will continue to do in operating this new museum in the city of San Francisco.',

Oregon has been the first state to legalize psilocybin assisted therapy. However, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies anticipates that MDMA-assisted therapy programs will cost between $13,000 -$15,000 per patient, and we are yet to understand the cost for psilocybin assisted therapy. With depression and anxiety being three times more likely in lower socioeconomic classes, our nation will be left in an imbalance, where only those who can afford psychedelic healing will have access. The Psychedelic Access Fund will help solve that problem. \n\n \n\nPAF will sponsor select individuals for healing opportunities in hopes to create a healed, conscious, and connected world. We will also partner with psychedelic facilities and retreat centers to establish “Pay It Forward” funds and sponsorship programs, so that no person is turned away from psychedelic healing, due to their inability to pay.',
